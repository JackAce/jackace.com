    Move over, Dogs Playing Poker—there's a new pooch in town, and he's not
    just playing the cards... he's streaming them live in glorious 1080p
    with RGB lighting.

    Introducing
    <a href="https://shop.jackace.com/products/dog-streaming-poker-poster" target="_blank">Dog Streaming Poker</a>,
    our cheeky homage to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Marcellus_Coolidge" target="_blank">Cassius Marcellus Coolidge's</a>
    iconic canine card sharks—but with a 21st-century twist. Instead of
    cigars and smoky backrooms, this bulldog is crushing online poker from
    his high-end gaming chair, surrounded by dual monitors, a blinding ring
    light, and a neon Twitch sign that reads “Ruffhouse Poker.” And yes, his
    mouse-handling paws are 100% tournament ready.
</p>

<p>
    This isn't just art. It's the story of a jowly underdog grinding
    microstakes, tanking tough decisions, and becoming a legend—one
    bluff at a time. With his motivational wall print “Limp, Tank, Shove”
    hanging proudly in the background, this pup reminds us that the real
    grind starts after walkies.
