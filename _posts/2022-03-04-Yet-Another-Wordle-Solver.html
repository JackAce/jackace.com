<p>
    Wordle, the game that took the internet by storm in late 2021, has been a hit amongst gamers and
    gamblers alike.

<h3>How to Play Wordle</h3>
<p>
    Wordle is a simple game where you try to solve the word of the day. Each guess
    receives a 🟩 or 🟨 square to indicate whether the letter is a direct hit for that position,
    or if it is found in a different slot.
</p>

<h3>The Inception</h3>
<p>
    On one of my first attempts, I got stuck and ended up busting out a pen and some paper to iterate through
    all of the possibilities... While spending about 15 minutes cycling through letter combinations, the
    inception of this solver was born. I knew a computer could do in just a fraction of a second what took me
    minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Plus, as a software engineer, I firmly believe that <i>"Anything worth doing a few times is worth automating."</i>
</p>
<p>
    So I wrote (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wordle+solvers" target="_blank">yet another</a>)
    Wordle solver!
</p>

<h2>Introducing the JackAce Wordle Solver!</h2>
<p>
    The JackAce Wordle Solver can be found here:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/games/wordle/solver/">https://www.jackace.com/games/wordle/solver/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    You can also find the Wordle Solver using the Navigation Bar under "Other".
</p>

<h2>How to Use the JackAce Wordle Solver</h2>
<p>
    There are three parts to the JackAce Wordle Solver:
</p>

<h3>The Suggestion List</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-03-04/02-parts-suggestions-800x785.png" alt="Select one of the suggested words and submit it on the Wordle site." />
    <figcaption>
        Select one of the suggested words and submit it on the Wordle site.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    This is the list of words on the right-hand side of the screen. Select one of these suggested words
    and submit it to Wordle.
</p>
<p>
    The list puts the highest ranked words on top. If the word is part of the Official
    solution list (if it is a valid solution to the Wordle), then the words' tiles will have a
    white border. If it is a valid word submission, but not an "Official" solution word, then the
    tiles' border will be light grey.
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind that most Wordle clone sites don't adhere to the Official word list for possible
    solutions.
</p>
<p>
    The tiles are also colored according to how they were previously scored. So 🟩 "Direct Hit"
    letters will be colored in green and 🟨 "Near Miss" letters will be colored yellow.
</p>
<p>
    After you've submitted your suggested word to Wordle, click on the word you chose to
    populate your current submission on the Main Board.
</p>

<h3>The Main Board</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-03-04/03-parts-main-800x785.png" alt="The Main Board of the Wordle Solver." />
    <figcaption>
        Color code your submissions by clicking on the tile so that it matches what Wordle returned.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    After you've submitted your suggested guess (or your own guess), you should fill in the Wordle
    Solver with your results. If you've used one of our suggestions, you can just click the word
    to fill in the Main Board. If you've supplied your own guess, you can type it in using your
    desktop keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.
</p>
<p>
    Before you request the next set of suggestions, make sure you color-code the main board to
    match the results you got from Wordle. You can click on each tile to cycle between 🟩, 🟨,
    and ⬜. When your board matches Wordle's board, press Enter. The JackAce Wordle Solver even
    helps you by pre-populating the state of the letter for you based on previous responses.
</p>

<h3>The Keyboard</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-03-04/04-parts-keyboard-469x162.png" alt="The On-Screen Keyboard" />
    <figcaption>
        The letters of the keyboard should match the status your submissions. Whiffs are black,
        near misses are yellow, direct hits are green, and unknown letters are grey.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    This is an on-screen keyboard that also updates itself based on your hit/miss responses.
    Letters that are not part of your Wordle's solution are dark grey. Unused
    letters are light grey. Direct hits are green, and near misses are yellow.
</p>
<p>
    There's also a RESET button if you want to start another Solver session. You can also
    press Escape to reset the board if you're on a desktop.
</p>

<h2>Word Scoring and Ranking</h2>
<p>
    There are two word lists for the New York Times version of Wordle. They have a list of
    words that are valid final solutions to the word of the day, and they have a list of
    words that they accept that can be used to eliminate letters and probe for hints.
</p>
<p>
    As you find matches and misses, the word lists are whittled down. Amongst the remaining
    words, the JackAce Wordle Solver counts the occurence of each letter and awards each word
    with the most common letters with the highest score. Letters are also weighted with
    vowels being worth more.
</p>

<h2>Why Does This Exist?</h2>
<blockquote>
    Jack, you've managed to take a fun little game and you've <i>completely</i> sucked the life
    out of it!
    <footer>
        - you, probably
    </footer>
</blockquote>
<p>
    I don't really expect you to use this solver instead of playing the game on your own. Maybe you'd
    use it if you <i>REALLY</i> got stuck after 5 guesses and you wanted to keep your streak alive,
    but that's probably it.
</p>
<p>
    This solver only exists because I wanted to see how hard it would be to make it. Plus, in my
    mind, using a solver <i>that I wrote</i> is as valid as solving a Wordle manually.
</p>
<p>
    I still play the game without solver, but I really enjoy seeing whether my solver can find the
    right solution in 2 or 3 guesses! It's also fun to see if you can guess in fewer tries than the
    solver.
</p>

<h3>Back End Source Code Available</h3>
<p>
    And if you want to take a look at the back end code, it's currently hosted
    <a href="https://github.com/JackAce/wordlesolver" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It's written in Node.js and hosted on Heroku. And full disclaimer -- I'm not much of a Node.js
    programmer. I just wanted to have an easy way to deploy this to the cloud and this was the easiest
    and cheapest way to get it there.
</p>
<h3>Front End Source Code Available, too</h3>
<p>
    The UI for the solver is just part of this site, which you should already know is
    <a href="https://github.com/JackAce/jackace.com/blob/main/assets/js/wordle-solver.js" target="_blank" >publicly hosted on GitHub</a>.
    I may move this to its own single page app with its own host name in the near future.
</p>

<h2>Give it a Shot!</h2>
<p>
    If you want to give it a spin, go for it! I find it's best to do a few rounds on one of the
    many Wordle clone sites, like
    <a href="https://wordleunlimited.com/" target="_blank">Wordle Unlimited</a>, which allows you
    to do back-to-back-to-back Wordles without having to wait until midnight to try the next one.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't really try to make it as good as possible, I just tried to apply an algorithm that
    matched what I was trying to do manually. In the future, I may iterate on it to make it more
    efficient and add unit and performance tests. If you see something that would improve the
    solver, please open a
    <a href="https://github.com/JackAce/wordlesolver/compare" target="_blank">Pull Request</a>
    in GitHub!
