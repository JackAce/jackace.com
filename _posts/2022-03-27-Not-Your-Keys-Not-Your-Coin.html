<p>
    If all of your crypto is on an exchange, do you really own it?
</p>

<p>
    If your exchange has all of its assets stolen, or if a rogue employee decides to walk
    away with the company's coffer, how would you get your money back?
</p>
<p>
    The short answer is <i>you won't</i>.
</p>
<p>
    There is little to no protection for a crypto investor whose assets are kept with a
    third-party company. The FDIC won't protect you from any losses if your exchange goes
    belly-up. Law enforcement won't likely lift a finger if your off-shore gambling site
    just decides that they don't want to honor your deposit.
</p>

<h2>Why is your Crypto in Jeopardy?</h2>
<p>
    There are 3 major dangers that put your coins in peril:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mismanagement (by inexperienced startup companies)
    </li>
    <li>
        Malice (by crooks)
    </li>
    <li>
        Misconduct (by you)
    </li>
</ul>   

<h2>Mismanagement</h2>
<h3>Everyone in Crypto Is Inexperienced</h3>
<p>
    If you need a great attorney, there are over million to choose from in the US. If you need a
    great accountant, there are also over a million.
</p>
<p>
    And both of these professions have well established certification processes to ensure the
    "professionals" know what they're doing. You can make sure your attorney is a member of
    the state bar association and you can verify that your accountant is a Certified Public
    Accountant.
</p>
<p>
    However, there isn't a widely recognized certification process for cryptocurrency
    professionals. Even the highly-regarded <i>"experts"</i> only have a few years of experience
    working with it and they mostly learned it on the job or by reading whitepapers and blogs.
    Crypto has really only existed since 2009, when the
    <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f">Genesis Block of Bitcoin</a>
    was mined.
</p>
<h3>Everyone in Crypto Loves Risk</h3>
<p>
    And nearly <i>EVERYONE</i> involved in crypto could be categorized as a risk taker. Most
    people get into crypto because of its potential to reach stratospheric highs for those
    willing to risk a substantial amount.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of that risk is due to crypto's historical association with criminal activity, its
    <i>extreme</i> volatility, and because it's a brand new industry that has only existed for
    a decade. These risks aren't inherent in most other industries.
</p>
<p>
    And all of these factors are compounded <i>on top</i> of the extraordinary amount of
    risk-taking already associated with technology start-ups.
</p>
<h3>Crypto Companies are like Tech Startup Companies on Steroids</h3>
<p>
    I've worked with many non-crypto startups and I've seen them sacrifice legal compliance
    and strong security for the ability to
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-mark-zuckerberg-new-values-move-fast-and-break-things-2022-2" target="_target">"move fast and break things"</a>
    as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg so famously put it. Crypto companies take this to a
    <b>COMPLETELY</b> different level. A lack of security is a major reason why
    cryptocurrency companies fail.

<h3>Mt. Gox</h3>
<h4>740,000 BTC Stolen</h4>
<p>
    In June 2014, the largest Bitcoin exchange was being run by Mt. Gox, a website originally created
    to trade
    <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/" target="_blank">"Magic: The Gathering"</a> cards (MTGOX
    originally stood for "<b>M</b>agic: <b>T</b>he <b>G</b>athering <b>O</b>nline e<b>X</b>change").
</p>
<p>
    That month, Mt. Gox announced that <span class="amt-bad">740,000+ Bitcoin</span> went
    missing (then only worth $400M, and in 2022 worth almost $30 Billion), likely stolen by hackers.
    Their customers were never made whole.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        740,000 BTC was stolen from customers of Mt. Gox. This amount is worth almost $30 Billion in
        2022.

<h3>Bitfinex</h3>
<h4>120,000 BTC Stolen</h4>
<p>
    In 2016, almost 120,000 BTC (then worth around $60M USD and now worth more than $4 BILLION) was
    <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/08/us-officials-seize-bitcoin-from-2016-bitfinex-hack/" target="_blank">stolen from Crypto Exchange site Bitfinex</a>.
    At the time, this represented about 30% of customers' holdings and all customers were forced to
    take the brunt of the loss.
</p>
<p>
    Customers were "compensated" by being issued Bitfinex's <b>BFX</b> tokens at a rate of 1
    token for every dollar lost (30% of each customer's holdings). So if you had $100 of Bitcoin at
    the time of the breach, you still had $70 worth of (non-stolen) BTC and you were issued 30 BFX
    tokens for the $30 deficit in value. Within a few months all of those tokens were exchanged for stock
    in Bitfinex's parent company, iFinex. Apparently trading these tokens for stock was the only way
    to redeem them for any real value.
</p>
<p>
    If customers were able to hold on to their BTC, they would have seen it appreciate from $600 at
    the time of the theft to today's price of over $44,000. Instead, they were issued a fraction of
    their worth in the stock of Bitfinex's shitty company.

<h3>StakeHound and Fireblocks</h3>
<h4>Lost 38,178 ETH</h4>
<p>
    StakeHound promised people that you could "stake" Ethereum with them and earn rewards
    as they used that Ethereum to create "Validators" to support Ethereum's migration to
    Proof of Stake.
</p>
<p>
    StakeHound left a third-party company named Fireblocks handle the custody of that ETH,
    and in June 2021, Fireblocks reportedly lost the private keys to 38,178 ETH (currently
    worth $110+ Million USD) and did not have a backup.
</p>
<p>
    Not having access to the private keys means that the ETH is unrecoverable. It is unclear
    whether customers will ever be compensated for the loss.

<h2>Malice</h2>

<h3>Turkish Crypto Exchange Thodex</h3>
<h4>$2 Billion USD reportedly stolen by CEO</h4>
<p>
    In April 2021, Faruk Fatih Özer, CEO of the Turkish Crypto Exchange Thodex,
    <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/turkey-jails-6-crypto-probe-including-thodex-ceos-siblings-courthouse-2021-04-30/" target="_blank">reportedly fled</a>
    to Albania after <span class="amt-bad">$2 Billion</span> worth of customers' assets went missing.
    He is currently on the lam, leaving Thodex's 400,000 customers high and dry.

<h3>Wixiplay Casino</h3>
<h4>Online Casino cheats and doesn't honor Crypto withdrawals</h4>
<h5>claims Gambling Expert</h5>
<p>
    There are several online casinos out there that offer Cryptocurrency transactions as a
    method for making deposits. This is one way that they are able to get around US laws like the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006" target="_blank">Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act</a>
    (UIGEA), which prevent a US-based bank from making a deposit to an online gambling site.
</p>
<p>
    But for sites like Wixiplay, that's not the <i>only</i> way that they skirt the rules,
    according to gambling expert, Michael Shackleford (aka the
    <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/" target="_blank">"Wizard of Odds"</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Wikiplay had a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OXjKcheAug" target="_blank">provably unfair</a>
    dice game, and to make matters worse, they have been accused of not honoring withdrawal
    requests. Shackleford's has documented his struggles with getting his crypto withdrawn
    from their site in the linked video above.
</p>

        Shackleford claims that
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OXjKcheAug" target="_blank">Online Casino Wixiplay</a>
        was using an unfair dice game algorithm in addition to not honoring Bitcoin withdrawals.
    </figcaption>

<p>
    Not every online casino is malicious, but you really have to be cautious if you're going to
    use crypto to gamble online.
</p>

<h2>Misconduct</h2>
<p>
    When I say <i>"misconduct,"</i> I'm actually speaking about <i>your</i> misconduct. And when I
    say <i>"your misconduct,"</i> I actually mean someone else's notion of what defines misconduct,
    and whether or not your actions fit that definition.
</p>
<p>
    For example, many people are clamoring for crypto sites to freeze the accounts of
    <i>ANY</i> Russian national in response for Russia's current war with Ukraine. This
    includes any Russian player, not just Oligarchs who may be funding the war. This is
    due to the <a>perception</a> that anyone from Russia is bad, not due to actual
    wrongdoings.
</p>
<p>
    At the moment, the crypto sites have continued to allow Russian customers to access
    their funds, but the situation feels like it could change at any moment. We've already
    seen sites like
    <a href="https://pokerfuse.com/news/industry/217307-pokerstars-exits-russia-freezes-customer-funds/" target="_blank">Poker Stars</a>
    block players from both playing and making cash (non-crypto) withdrawals.

<h3>Silk Road</h3>
<h4>144,000+ BTC Seized</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-03-27/06-silk-road-800x707.png" alt="The founder of Dark Web site Silk Road was arrested and all 144,000 BTC was seized." />
    <figcaption>
        Dark Web site the Silk Road was shut down and over 144,000 BTC was seized.
        Nothing was given back to customers, who primarily used the site for illegal
        activities.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    In 2013, the one of the largest Crypto sites was being run by a 29 year-old named
    Ross "Dread Pirate Roberts" Ulbricht. He ran the <i>Dark Web</i> site "Silk Road",
    which had taken in over $80 million in fees.
</p>
<p>
    Ulbricht oversaw over $1 BILLION in transactions through his site, which facilitated
    the sale of illegal drugs, fake IDs, and many other illicit items. He got caught after
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested">bragging on LinkedIn</a>
    about running a multi-million dollar drug marketplace.
</p>
<p>
    When the site was shut down in 2013, the FBI seized <span class="amt-bad">144,000+ Bitcoin</span>,
    including 26,000 BTC of Silk Road's customers' balances. That cache of Bitcoin was never returned to Silk
    Road customers. Due to the nature of the illegal purchases the customers were involved in,
    I doubt many of those people are going to come forward to stake their claim to their lost coin.
</p>

<h2>Take your Crypto off the Sites</h2>
<p>
    When you don't have complete control over your money (both crypto and 
    {% include glossary-term.html term="fiat" -%}), it's subject
    to being taken from you, and there are many reasons to believe it <i>will</i> be taken.
</p>
<p>
    I've had money taken away from me by PayPal because someone fraudulently lied to
    them about an eBay sale that I made and delivered as described.
</p>
<p>
    I know people who have had their Venmo accounts locked because the transaction comments
    mentioned the word "poker".
</p>
<p>
    I've had my NETELLER account frozen for months because I moved to a different country and
    they thought I was trying to commit fraud.
</p>
<p>
    If you entrust a large part of your life savings to a company that isn't safeguarded by
    established practices and regulatory protections, you shouldn't be surprised if you lose
    access to it all.
</p>
<p>
    So, to prevent yourself from being locked out of your funds due to their crappy management,
    their interpretation of your actions, or their straight up thievery, you should move your crypto
    off of exchanges, and interest earning sites.
</p>
<p>
    The best place to keep your crypto is in a crypto wallet. A crypto wallet allows you to receive
    and send crypto to <i>any</i> recipient, whether it be a church, a hospital, a gambling site,
    or a marijuana dispensary. When your coins are securely held in a wallet, no one else's incompetency
    or malice will result in you losing your money, and no one can freeze your account.
</p>
<p>
    You can purchase a hardware wallet made by a trustworthy manufacturer like
    <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank">Trezor</a>
    or <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a>. In the next few days, we'll
    teach you how to setup <i>and secure</i> a hardware wallet, so stay tuned!
