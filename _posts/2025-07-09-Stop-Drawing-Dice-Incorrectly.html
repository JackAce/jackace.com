<h3>
    Casino Dice Schematics: Why Do So Many Get This Wrong?
</h3>
<p>
    Look, I love dice. You love dice. If you're here reading this, you probably really love dice ‚Äî or at least pretend to when you sidle up to a craps
    table and toss around phrases like ‚ÄúYo-leven‚Äù and ‚Äúhorn-high ace-deuce.‚Äù
    But there's one thing that drives me absolutely nuts‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
    Bad dice drawings.
</p>

<p>
    I'm not talking about casual mistakes from a toddler sketching a six-sided cube.
    I'm talking about full-grown adults ‚Äî dice enthusiasts, even casino artists! ‚Äî who
    somehow can't follow the very basic, universal standards that even the junky plastic
    dice in a Monopoly box respect.
</p>
<p>
    So let's set the record straight. If you're going to draw dice, design dice, photograph
    dice, or plaster them all over your gambling-themed products, you should at least know
    what actual casino dice are supposed to look like.
</p>
<h3>
    The Sacred Rules of Casino Dice
</h3>
<p>
    Here's what you need to understand:
</p>
<p>
    Real casino dice aren't just random cubes with dots slapped on them. They're precision
    instruments, machined to perfection, and they always follow these basic principles:
</p>
<h4>
    üé≤ 1Ô∏è‚É£ The opposite sides always add up to 7
</h4>
<p>
    This is not a suggestion. It's math.
</p>
<p>
    {% include die-face.html value=1 %}
    should be opposite of
    {% include die-face.html value=6 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    {% include die-face.html value=2 %}
    should be opposite of
    {% include die-face.html value=5 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    {% include die-face.html value=3 %}
    should be opposite of
    {% include die-face.html value=4 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    Simple and universal. If your drawing has 3 and 4 on adjacent sides,
    congratulations, you've created some kind of cursed object that belongs in
    a dollar store.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/01-bad-sides-300x271.png" alt="Two dice with invalid side numbers" />
    <figcaption>
        The left die has a 2 next to a 5. The right die has a 3 next to a 4. In both
        cases, the number should be on the opposite face of its complement.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    üé≤ 2Ô∏è‚É£ The 1, 2, and 3 all meet at a common corner
</h4>
<p>
    On a standard die, there's always one corner where you can see the
    {% include die-face.html value=1 -%},
    {% include die-face.html value=2 -%}, and
    {% include die-face.html value=3 %}
    faces touching. It's the easiest way to orient yourself and the surest way to
    spot a malformed imposter.
</p>
<p>
    ALSO, the 
    {% include die-face.html value=2 %}
    and the
    {% include die-face.html value=3 %}
    should form a "V" when you look at the two shared faces with the 
    {% include die-face.html value=1 %} on top. When oriented like this,
    the
    {% include die-face.html value=2 %}
    should be on the left, and the 
    {% include die-face.html value=3 %}
    should be on the right.
</p>
<p>
    This means that the corner that the three faces share does not contain a pip.
    I learned this when I was 8 years old and I noticed that if you spin a die
    with that corner on top, the corner will be free of any pip.
</p>
<div class="infobox-info">
    On dice, a "pip" refers to one of the small dots on a face of the die that
    represent numbers from 1 to 6.
</div>
<p>
    Just look at the Die Emoji! They actually got this one right (if you ignore
    the color of the 1 Pip).
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-size: 100px;">üé≤</span>
</p>
<h4>
    üé≤ 3Ô∏è‚É£ The 6 face has a specific orientation
</h4>
<p>
    It goes "up and down," meaning if you're looking at a properly aligned die,
    the rows of three dots on the   
    {% include die-face.html value=6 %}
    face run vertically, with the
    {% include die-face.html value=3 %}
    and
    {% include die-face.html value=4 %}
    faces adjacent to the opening edges.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        Here, the die on the left has a 6 that correctly opens up to the 4. The die on
        the right has a 6 that correctly opens up to the 3.
    </figcaption>

<h3>
    The Physical Standards of Casino Dice
</h3>
<p>
    Beyond just how they look, casino dice are designed with rigorous precision:
</p>
<h4>
    üíé Translucency
</h4>
<p>
    They're clear, so you can see through them. Why? To prevent tampering or loading.
    If someone gives you opaque dice at the craps table, you should hand them back
    and then immediately sanitize your hands.
</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/04-transluscent-300x300.png" alt="Five red, transluscent dice" />
    <figcaption>
        You can see there is nothing fishy going on inside these five casino dice!
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    ‚öñÔ∏è Flat, painted dots (not indented)
</h4>
<p>
    Those classic little indented pips? Forget them ‚Äî that's for children's board
    games. Casino dice have perfectly flat surfaces with painted dots. Why? Because
    digging holes for the dots would mess with the balance. The last thing you want
    is the 1 face landing on the felt more than it should just because some designer
    didn't understand basic physics.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/05-concave-300x277.png" alt="Two white dice with carved out pips" />
    <figcaption>
        You can see that the dots in these game dice are carved out of the material.
        This results in dice that are not "true" and it introduces possible bias
        towards the larger numbers.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    üìê Sharp, square edges
</h4>
<p>
    Casino dice have razor-sharp corners, not the rounded edges of your friendly
    neighborhood Yahtzee set. You can (and should!) be able to spin one like a
    miniature fidget spinner by pinching two opposite corners.
</p>
<h3>
    Can you spot what's wrong? Can you identify the Kosher dice?
</h3>
<p>
    So, how's your eye for valid dice? Care to test your skills? Here's a mixture 
    of correctly and incorrectly illustrated dice. Can you tell which ones are invalid
    and why?
</p>
<h4>
    Die 1: 1/2/5
</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/50-q1-1-2-5-200x200.png" alt="A die with 1 on top, 2 on the left, and 5 on the right" />
    <figcaption>
        Hopefully you see that the 2 and the 5 add up to 7, which means that they should
        be on opposite faces, not next to each other. This die is INVALID.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    Die 2: 6/4/3
</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/51-q2-6-4-3-200x200.png" alt="A die with 6 on top, 4 on the left, and 3 on the right" />
    <figcaption>
        Hopefully you see that the 4 and the 3 add up to 7, which means that they should
        be on opposite faces, not next to each other. This die is INVALID.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    Die 3: 6/5/3
</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/52-q3-6-5-3-200x200.png" alt="A die with 6 on top, 5 on the left, and 3 on the right" />
    <figcaption>
        Nothing wrong with this one! It's perfectly valid! The 6 opens up to the 3 here.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    Die 4: 6/4/5
</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/53-q4-6-4-5-200x200.png" alt="A die with 6 on top, 4 on the left, and 5 on the right" />
    <figcaption>
        Here, the 6 opens up to the 5. The 6 should only open up to the 4 or the 3. This
        die is INVALID.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    Die 5: 1/2/3
</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/54-q5-1-2-3-200x200.png" alt="A die with 1 on top, 2 on the left, and 3 on the right" />
    <figcaption>
        The corner shared with the 1, 2, and 3 has the 2 and 3 forming a "V" with the
        joining corner touching the 1. This is INVALID. The shared 1/2/3 corner should NOT
        have a single spot in the corner.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    Die 6: 1/2/3
</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2025-07-09-dice-schematics/55-q6-1-2-3-200x200.png" alt="A die with 1 on top, 2 on the left, and 3 on the right" />
    <figcaption>
        Here's the CORRECT way the shared corner is formed by the 1, 2, and 3. There is
        NO dot in the shared corner. This die is VALID.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>
    Why This Matters
</h3>
<p>
    Whenever I see malformed dice in artwork, marketing, or even from self-proclaimed
    dice ‚Äúaficionados,‚Äù I absolutely cringe.
</p>
<p>
    How can you claim to love dice and not know what real dice are supposed to
    look like?!
</p>
<p>
    Even the factory-made dice that come bundled with Monopoly respect these rules!
    It's frankly embarrassing when so-called "craps enthusiasts" post artwork
    featuring impossible dice that no real casino would ever allow on a table.
</p>
<p>
    And now that you know these rules ‚Äî well, you can't unsee it either.
</p>
<p>
    Every off-kilter dot, every backwards face, every rounded corner you spot in
    an ad or design from this day forward‚Ä¶ it'll jump out at you. And you're
    welcome.
</p>
<p>
    So let's all do better, shall we? Respect the dice. Love the dice. Draw
    them correctly.
