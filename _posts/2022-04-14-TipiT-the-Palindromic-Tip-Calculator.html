        You can be pretty confident that your credit card charges weren't tampered with
        if you use <a href="https://tipit.jackace.com/" target="_blank">TipiT</a>, the Palindromic Tip Calculator.

<p>
    No more fumbling with restaurant and bar receipts when you get your credit card bill!
    With <a href="https://tipit.jackace.com/" target="_blank">TipiT</a>,
    you can <i>easily</i> tell whether your receipt totals have been manipulated!
</p>

<h2>Beware of Dishonest Servers and Bar Staff</h2>
<p>
    Unfortunately, there are a lot of dishonest people in the service industry
    <i>(as there are in every industry)</i>
    who are quick to line their pockets with the money of unsuspecting customers. These
    servers can take advantage of their patrons with a few strokes of the pen. They do this
    by illegally altering the tip and total of your meal's check, increasing thier tips for
    the day.
</p>
<p>
    For example, let's say you get a bill for $59.58. A typical tip might be $11.42 (19.1%),
    bringing the total to $71.00. A dishonest server could easily turn the $11.42 tip into a $19.42
    tip, bringing your total to $79.00 (changing the "1" to a "9" in both the tip and the total),
    increasing his tip by $8 (a 72% increase for him!).

<p>
    That $8 bump in your dinner bill may not set off any alarms unless you were specifically
    remembered that transaction or if you were manually reconciling your credit card statement
    every month.
</p>

<h2>Reconcile your Credit Card Bill in Seconds!</h2>
<p>
    I used to spend <b>hours</b> every month reconciling my credit card statements, making sure
    every charge was valid and that restaurant and bar charges weren't padded with extra tips by
    dishonest servers and bartenders. I've caught several instances of my receipts not matching,
    sometimes due to fraud and sometimes due to seemingly innocent mistakes (where the total was
    only off by a few cents).
</p>
<p>
    Now with TipiT, reconciling restaurant and bar charges can be done in seconds. You only have
    to investigate suspicious looking charges, which should rarely occur.

    <figcaption>
        My restaurant bills may look large, but that's because I have 4 kids by 5 mothers.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    The above screenshot is from a recent credit card bill. I removed some items where tipping
    was not possible and I am displaying the totals for all my restaurant and bar charges.
</p>
<p>
    Everything looks legit! <i>Can you tell why?</i>
</p>

<h2>Make Your Totals into a Palindrome</h2>
<p>
    If you've got a good eye, you noticed that all the above charges are <i>"palindromic"</i>.
    If you ignore the decimal point, the numbers read the same backwards and forwards. For
    example, the bar charge from Skyloft was a total of $36.63, and "3663" backwards is still
    "3663".
</p>
<p>
    If you <i>always</i> make your restaurant and bar charges palindromic, you can easily identify
    charges on your credit card statement that may have been manipulated.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        It's difficult to increase the amount of the tip while keeping the total a palindrome.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Is Making Your Total a Palindrome Bulletproof?</h2>
<p>
    No. You're still susceptible to fraudulent charges if your server is observative and both your
    tip <i>AND</i> your total happen to be manipulatable.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if your bill is $100.00 and you tip $20.21 for a total of $120.21, then your waiter
    can still turn your $20.21 tip into a $28.21 tip, for a total of $128.21.
</p>
<p>
    But for this to happen, the following stars must align:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your server has to <i>recognize</i> that you're intentionally making your total a palindrome.
    </li>
    <li>
        The total can't raise a red flag to you or to your credit card company. It would be easy
        change a total of "$12.34" to "$43212.34" by adding $43,200 to both the tip and the total,
        but this would certainly get rejected by the credit card company and immediately noticed by you.
        Also spending over $400 at the local taqueria for lunch would stick out like a sore thumb
        upon review.
    </li>
    <li>
        The doctored receipt must hold up to scrutiny. You can change 1's into 7's or 9's, and you
        can change 0's to 8's or 6's, but you probably couldn't change a "3" into a "7".
    </li>
    <li>
        Your server has to <i>want to</i> rip off someone who has already shown a concern about fraud.
        Since you've already demonstrated that you're concerned with fraud, the bad actor would
        be less likely to target you. It's like a burglar who passes over homes with security
        system stickers on their windows.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your server has to be able to perform the math necessary to commit this fraud, which is
        probably less common than you think (not just amongst servers, but amongst the general
        population).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>(re) Introducing TipiT: The Palindromic Tip Calculator!</h2>
<p>
    I used to manually perform these tip calculations in my head, but in 2014, I wrote an
    iPhone app called <b>TipiT</b> to do the work for me. 
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-04-14/03-tipit-appstore-474x265.png" alt="TipiT in the iOS App Store" title="TipiT in the iOS App Store" />
    <figcaption>
        The first version of TipiT was released in the Apple App Store in 2014.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Since then, I've stopped supporting the iOS version of this app and it was consequently removed
    from the App Store.
</p>
<p>
    But <b>good news</b>! TipiT has officially been
    <b>re-introduced</b> with a <i>free</i> web version! To use the new TipiT calculator, go to
</p>

    <a href="https://tipit.jackace.com" target="_blank">https://tipit.jackace.com</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    TipiT is best viewed from your mobile phone, although using it from a tablet or your laptop
    works just fine (if you're the type of person who eats at restaurants with your laptop, I guess?).
</p>
<p>
    When you open your browser to TipiT, you'll see the TipiT calculator.

    Use the calculator buttons to input your bill total! No need to type in the desired percentage.
    TipiT will display an array of possible tips and totals as you type!

    When your total amount is complete, the calculator disappears, giving you a full screen view
    of your options. If your desired percentage is not visible, you can scroll through the results
    by swiping.

    The smallest tip percentages are colored in red. As you move higher in percent, the color will
    change to yellow and then to green. Green colored tips would correspond to the best level of
    service.

    If you've mistyped the subtotal, you can click on the
