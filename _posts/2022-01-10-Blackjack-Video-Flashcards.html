    Using flashcards is one of the best ways to master learning, whether it be for
    studying for the SAT, learning a new language, or just learning your
    times tables.
</p>
<p>
    The same can be said for memorizing Blackjack Basic Strategy.
</p>

<p>
    When I learned Basic Strategy over 30 years ago, I scribbled down the 250+
    Basic Strategy decisions onto index cards and flipped them over one-by-one until
    I had all of the answers down pat.
</p>
<h2>Introducing Blackjack Basic Strategy Video Flashcards</h2>
<p>
    With the invention of smartphones, you now have <i>multiple</i> options when it comes
    to rote memorization.
</p>
<p>
    Not only can you listen to a Soundcloud audio playist to help you
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/05/Learn-Blackjack-in-your-Sleep/">learn
    Blackjack in your sleep</a>, but now you can learn Basic Strategy by simply
    watching videos on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCINg22R9y7_qrYXH1zWwIVQ">YouTube</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I've created over 300 videos that you can shuffle to help learn Blackjack Basic Strategy.
    Each track corresponds to a specific player versus dealer scenario that you might find on a
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/charts/MD_S17/">Blackjack
    Basic Strategy chart</a> (e.g. "Soft 15 (A-4) versus Dealer 4"). The track will show the
    player's hand and dealer's upcard, and reveal the proper action (Hit, Stand, Double,
    Split, or Surrender) shortly afterwards. Treat each track like a pop-quiz and you
    can learn all 250+ decisions in no time!
</p>
<p>
    There are 6 playlists that are separated according to the house rules you want to play
    against. Just select the playlist that best suits your needs and hit shuffle to listen to
    each track in random order.
</p>

    Here's a sample of the 4+ Deck/Stand on Soft 17 playlist:
