    So you made it past
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2025/05/19/RDR2-Gambler-8-Challenge/" >Gambler 8</a>?    
    Welcome to the thinking man's side hustle: DOMINOES. In Red Dead
    Redemption 2, completing the Gambler 9 Challenge means you need to win
    3 games of dominoes in a row, and let me tell you, this ain't your
    Grampa's Sunday picnic.
</p>
<p>
    Rockstar didn't make this easy. But with the right tactics (and
    a healthy respect for numbers), you can become the undisputed
    domino king of the frontier.

</p>
<p>
    Seriously.
</p>

<p>
    This is the foundation of your strategy. Keep it next to you like
    it's Arthur's journal. If you're trying to beat this challenge
    without knowing the full set of dominoes, you're about as prepared
    as Uncle on a cattle drive.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've got that printed sheet? Cut them out. Yes, with irl
    scissors. Then, as you draw dominoes in-game or see them played, sort
    the cutouts into three physical piles:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Dominoes you have
    </li>
    <li>
        Dominoes that have been played
    </li>
    <li>
        Dominoes your opponent might still be holding
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Forget mental math or scribbled notes. This tactile method is the
    cleanest way to deduce your opponent's options and dominate the table.
    Plus, it makes you feel like you're planning a train robbery with Dutch.
</p>

<h3>
    General Strategy Tips (aka: How to Dominate with Dots)
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Know your numbers.</b> After receiving your initial set of tiles, figure out
    which numbers you're rich in and which ones you're broke on. If you have three
    or more dominoes showing the same number, that's your golden ticket.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Control the board.</b> If you can cap all open ends with a number you're
    rich in, you're choking your opponent's options. Think of it as putting
    a lasso around their whole game.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Bleed the opponent dry.</b> If you're down to a couple tiles and suspect
    your opponent is stuck, keep the pressure on. Even a tie ("blocked game")
    can work in your favor if you have fewer points in hand.

<h3>
    Gambler 9: Three Wins in a Row Without Losing Your Mind
</h3>
<p>
    Winning one game of dominoes? Easy. Winning three in a row? That's where
    Rockstar earns their name. Here's how to stack the tiles in
    your favor:
</p>
<h4>
    1. Play One-on-One
</h4>
<p>
    Always, always try to play against a <i>single opponent</i>. Fewer players means
    fewer variables. If you see a table where there are multiple folks playing,
    just save your game, reload, or leave and come back later. You can even set
    up camp nearby and sleep to reset the NPCs.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Emerald Station</i> is your best friend here. There's almost always a game running,
    and it's just a short trot away from a good campsite. If things go south, you
    can stand up, sleep for a bit, and check the game again a reset.
</p>

    <figcaption>I like Emerald Station for playing, but you may prefer other locations based on the game offered</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>
    2. Know When to Fold 'Em (Or... Walk Away Mid-Game)
</h4>
<p>
    Yes, you can <i>walk away mid-game</i> without penalty to your win streak. If you
    feel like your opponent just laid down the equivalent of a stacked deck, get
    up and walk away. Come back, and boom, clean slate.
</p>
<p>
    But be warned: if you're playing at your gang's camp (Horseshoe Overlook,
    Clemens Point, Shady Belle), standing up ends the session. You'll have to
    wait for a new game to randomly become available later. Stick to <i>Emerald Station</i>
    or other locations for Gambler 9.
</p>
<h4>
    3. Reset Smart, Not Hard
</h4>
<p>
    Save before <i>every</i> match once you're on a win streak.
    You can even rotate saves. If you win a game, save. If you lose the next,
    reload. It's save scumming, sure, but so is reloading checkpoints after
    accidentally tackling a shopkeeper.
</p>
<h3>
    BONUS: The Secret to Gambler 5 - Always Leave Yourself an Out
</h3>
<p>
    This one often gets overlooked, but if you're trying to complete the
    <i>Gambler 5 Challenge</i>, you need to win a game of dominoes without
    drawing any tiles. And for that, there's a critical rule:
</p>
<p>
    Try to leave yourself an out.
</p>
<p>
    Here's why: if you ever find yourself unable to play, you'll be forced
    to draw—and poof, challenge failed.
</p>
<p>
    The best case is when your tile can be played on two or more ends of the
    board.
</p>
<p>
    The next best case is when your tile can be played on one end only.
</p>
<p>
    The worst case is when you have no legal moves and must hope your opponent
    plays a tile that opens the board up again. That's cowboy Russian
    roulette. Do they even have cowboys in Russia?
</p>
<p>
    Use
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J8GhSjbw3W1DjmPl7cA_QE8Ywb8ChXLn?usp=sharing" target="_blank">your PDF printout</a>
    here, too! As dominoes are played and sorted into your
    three piles, you can start to predict what your opponent has left. Based on
    what remains, choose the play that gives you the highest probability of your
    opponent making a move that doesn't lock you out.
</p>
<p>
    And this tip also helps with Gambler 9, but it's CRITICAL for Gambler 5, where
    you <b>can't</b> draw tiles. Stay sharp and play defensively. Gambler 5 isn't
    about domination—it's about survival.
</p>
<h3>
    Final Tip: Play Like Arthur Would
</h3>
<p>
    Dominoes in RDR2 isn't just about luck—it's about observing patterns,
    knowing when to push and when to retreat. Kinda like dealing with Micah.
</p>
<p>
    If you take your time, play methodically, and don't let your ego write
    checks your tiles can't cash, you'll knock out Gambler 9 without needing
    Dead Eye.
</p>
<p>
    And when you do? That satisfying sound of that last tile hitting the table
    is almost as good as a clean headshot in Dead Eye slow-mo.
</p>
<h3>
    Final Thoughts
</h3>
<p>
    Dominoes can feel a bit like a chore if you're rushing through the
    challenges. But if you approach it like a mini-game of deduction and
    control, it's actually one of the most strategic diversions in the game.
</p>
<p>
    So print that domino chart, cut it up, sort your piles, saddle up to the
    Emerald Station table, and get to work.

<p>
    Good luck, cowboy. And remember: the fewer dots in your hand, the closer
    you are to victory.
