<p>
    So, I recently published a few videos on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7_Bpai9n_1a39GneHO5hlZIO56oYvn1" target="_blank">how to solve the Rubik's Cube</a>.
    In making those videos, I learned a lot of things, including that the way I learned may not be the
    easiest way to learn... But one side effect of creating those videos was a few ideas on how
    teaching others could be improved.
</p>
<p>
    One of the stepping stones of the Rubik's Cube solving process is learning
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2024/01/09/Rubiks-Cube-Move-Notation/">Move Notations</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I thought there were issues with the many different sources of images you might
    find online that show you each move. I wanted to improve what was out there for future
    generations of people who want to learn how to cube.
</p>

<p>
    One thing I already did was provide an animated video to illustrate the 12 most common
    moves. You can find that video below.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h152PyEkjiY?si=AEt0mXZ2fM7XAwgc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
    In addtion to this video, I wanted to create easy to read, easy to understand images
    that demonstrate each move. I wanted the images to have the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A cube with the moving face in a partially moved state.
    </li>
    <li>
        The arrows that indicate motion should be curved and not directly
        on top of the moving face.
    </li>
    <li>
        It should be self-evident which direction the moving face is going
        even without the arrow. This should be inferred by the colors on
        the pieces
    </li>
    <li>
        3 faces of the cube should be visible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determining which face is the Front, Left, Right, Upper, or Lower (Down) should
        be self-evident.
    </li>
    <li>
        Different colored background for Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise moves.
    </li>
    <li>
        Different colored arrows for Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise moves.
    </li>
    <li>
        Contrasting colors used between arrows and backgrounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arrows and backgrounds should avoid using colors of displayed pieces.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each move could be separated into its own image for copying and pasting into
        tutorials.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've already shown you the composite graphic with all 12 moves. Here's each individual move
    in its own image.

<p>
    I'm also working on several different graphics that I'd like to share via Creative Commons
    licensing. I have an illustration that can be used to show the names associated with each face.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2024-05-31-rubiks-cube-moves-2/01-faces-600x600.png" alt="Rubik's Cube with all 6 sides visible." />
    <figcaption>
        I wanted a way to show all 6 faces. This graphic projects the hidden faces so you can see
        the colors on them.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    I'm crafting other graphics and animations as well. I plan to have every move animated as a YouTube
    Short and I'll probably provide animated GIFs as well. I'll have the M/E/S slice moves and x/y/z
    cube rotations, too.
</p>
<p>
    This project is a work in progress, so I'm open to suggestions! What else would you like to see?
