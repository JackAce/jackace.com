    I've recently launched a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgJlRbG89VQ&list=PLf7_Bpai9n_1a39GneHO5hlZIO56oYvn1" target="_blank">video series on how to solve the Rubik's Cube</a>
    on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceDotCom?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
</p>
<p>
    One thing you really need to learn if you want to solve the Rubik's Cube is the notations that are
    used when describing a series of moves you need to memorize. This can look like gobbledegook if you're
    unfamiliar with what the notation means.

    <figcaption>This is an example of existing graphics demonstrating move notation</figcaption>

<p>
    I've seen the move notations paired up with still images with arrows indicating the cited
    direction, but we live in a digital age, so I wanted to provide an animated version of this
    graphic!
</p>
<p>
    So I've created a video that shows you each move! Here it is!

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h152PyEkjiY?si=AEt0mXZ2fM7XAwgc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    This video along with
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgJlRbG89VQ&list=PLf7_Bpai9n_1a39GneHO5hlZIO56oYvn1" target="_blank">my video series</a>
    should be enough to teach you how to solve the Rubik's Cube in a
    matter of days.
</p>
<p>
    I really think this will be a great way for many people to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube.
    I learned how to solve it when it was first sold in the United States back in 1980 or 1981. So as
    far as content creators go, I'm probably the one who has known how to solve the Rubik's Cube for
    longest amount of time!
</p>
<p>
    So check out my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgJlRbG89VQ&list=PLf7_Bpai9n_1a39GneHO5hlZIO56oYvn1" target="_blank">video series</a>
    if you are interested in learning how to solve the Rubik's Cube!

    And if you really want to learn the way I'm teaching the internet, make sure you pick up a
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3uCIrhu" target="_blank" >Magic Cube</a>!
    It really helps you focus on the part of the lesson that I'm teaching!
