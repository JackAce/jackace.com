<h3>
    There are only 24 possible angles that you should see
</h3>
<p>
    So as a follow up to my last post on how to
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2025/07/09/Stop-Drawing-Dice-Incorrectly/">Draw Dice Correctly</a>,
    I've decided to create a blog post with every single possible die angle
    that you should be able to see.
</p>
<p>
    There are exactly 24 <i>valid</i> orientations when you're looking at a standard casino die.
    That's it. No more, no less. If you're seeing something different in a drawing, rendering,
    emoji, or logo, it's wrong.
</p>

<p>
    Here are the canonical 24 angles:

<p>
    Not only should the combination of Pips be located in one of these 24 images, but
    the <i>orientation</i> of the pips should match the images. That means the angle of
    the {% include die-face.html value=3 %} and the {% include die-face.html value=2 %}
    should match, and the {% include die-face.html value=6 %} should open up to either 
    the {% include die-face.html value=3 %} or the {% include die-face.html value=4 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    If an artist, designer, 🎲 emoji creator, or even a game developer gives you something
    outside these 24 angles... they've botched it. Even a standard Monopoly die obeys
    these rules.

    Consider this your die-truth gospel. Bookmark it. Call it out when you see bad dice
    art. You're officially deputized in the Department of Dice Accuracy™.

<p>
    Want to understand why only these 24 angles are possible? It all comes down to
    opposite sides adding to 7, and the way corners align on real dice. Check out the
