<p>
    What's the best way to keep your cryptocurrency wallet secure? There are three <i>essential</i> steps
    that you should take to keep your crypto safe.
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create and Secure a 24-Word Seed Phrase
        </li>
        <li>
            Create and Secure an extra Passphrase to create a hidden wallet
        </li>
        <li>
            Create and Secure your PIN
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Create and Secure a 24-Word Seed Phrase</h2>
<p>
    The first step in securing your hardware wallet is creating a secure 24-word Seed Phrase. This
    a randomly generated phrase that is used to help create a set of keys needed to store your crypto.
</p>
<p>
    Even though shorter phrases (12 or 18 words) are usually an option, you should use the 24 word
    option, which is the most secure.
</p>
<p>
    Seed phrases used with <i>most</i> hardware wallets are based on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
    #39 specifications
    (<a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase" target="_blank">BIP39</a>).
    This means that if your wallet breaks and the manufacturer has gone out of business, it is
    possible to restore your wallet on another BIP39 compliant hardware wallet and still access
    your coins.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-30/01-bip39-word-list-500x368.png" alt="BIP39 Word List"/>
    <figcaption>
        You should use a 24-Word Seed Phrase. This is preferable over the shorter and less-secure
        12 and 18 word phrases.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    There are 2048 words to choose from, so selecting a 12, 18, or 24 word seed phrase will result in a
    cosmicly large number of possible permutations. The number of possible 24 word phrases is roughly
    equivalent to <i>30% of the number of atoms in the known universe</i>!
</p>
<p>
    This 2048 word list is indexed, so when you are given a word, you've really just given an ordinal
    position on this list. So, if you prefer to see your phrase in Spanish, your phrase will be chosen
    from a different set of Spanish words. The same generated Seed Phrase will have different words with
    different meanings, but each word will have the same numeric position in the language-specific list.
    This is done in an effort to support Hodlers of every language.

<h3>How to Secure your Seed Phrase</h3>
<p>
    <b>NEVER</b> store your Seed Phrase electronically in <b>ANY FORM</b>. This means you need to
    write it down on paper, or better yet, you should scribe it or stamp it on metal. This copy of your
    Seed Phrase should be stored in a home safe or a safe deposit box (and <i>additional</i> precautions should
    be taken when using a safe deposit box).
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-30/02-stamped-phrase-800x533.jpg" alt="24-word Seed Phrase"/>
    <figcaption>
        There are several <i>must do</i> steps in securing your cryptocurrency wallet. Make sure
        you're doing them.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    This <i>also</i> means that you should not take a picture of it! Digital photos often end up
    on a Cloud server (either purposely or accidentally), where they can be scanned with OCR
    software and easily checked for words on the seed phrase list.
</p>
<p>
    And for this same reason, you should make sure you don't write the phrase down within visibility
    of a security camera, even within your own home.
</p>
<p>
    You should avoid recording your Seed Phrase in any of the following formats:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Any digital text file or word processing file
        </li>
        <li>
            In a Password Manager like LastPass or 1Password
        </li>
        <li>
            A photo of any format - digital or even print
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    Any person who has access to your Seed Phrase can recreate your wallet
    <i>without requiring physical access to your hardware wallet AND without knowing your PIN</i>.
    They can access all the crypto in your (main) wallet. This is why protecting your
    Seed Phrase <b>IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP</b> in securing your hardware wallet.
</p>
<p>
    Phishing scams that get crypto holders to volunteer their seed phrase are amongst the
    most common of crypto scams and have resulted in the looting of
    <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/15/celsius-suffers-third-party-data-breach-customers-report-phishing-texts-emails/" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a>
    worth of crypto. You need to ensure you keep your seed phrase 100% offline.
</p>
<p>
    And you should be extremely cautious about storing your seed phrase in a bank
    safe deposit box.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-30/03-nyt-safe-deposit-boxes-600x336.png" alt="NYT Article: Safe Deposit Boxes Aren't Safe"/>

        when Wells Fargo seized the contents of the wrong safe deposit box.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Not only is the safe deposit box seceptible to "legal" seizure by law enforcement, it is also
    seceptible to theft from a bank employee with a drill or even just a careless employee who
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html" target="_blank">seizes the contents of the wrong box</a>.
</p>
<p>
    A seed phrase stored with a third party isn't safe unless you combine
    the next security measure (the passphrase).
</p>

<h2>Create and Secure a "Passphrase" for your Seed Phrase</h2>
<p>
    The major hardware wallets all support an additional passphrase, sometimes referred to as a "25th Word".
</p>
<p>
    Of the three precautions that I've listed as "essential", this is the only one that is not
    strictly required by hardware wallet manufacturers.
</p>
<p>
    This passphrase can be used to create a "hidden" wallet (or multiple hidden wallets, if you
    desire). This is a passphrase of your own choosing, and isn't limited to the 2048 word list
    in the above seed phrase. It is suggested that your passphrase be a randomly generated string
    of characters, similar to a password genertated by a password manager.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use a string of words separated by spaces if so desired.
</p>

    <a href="https://wiki.trezor.io/Address_path_(BIP32)" target="_blank">BIP32</a>.

    <figcaption>
        Use a <i>passphrase</i> to unlock a hidden wallet or wallets.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    The passphrase protects your crypto from falling into the wrong hands if someone gets a hold
    of your Seed Phrase. If you were to keep that list in a safe deposit box, any banker
    with the authority to force open boxes (which can happen when you lose the key or if law
    enforcement tells them to).
</p>

<div class="infobox-info">
    If there is a "reasonable" suspicion that illegal items may be in a safe deposit box,
    law enforcement officials can obtain a court order to freeze the owner's access to
    it. In criminal cases investigators can force the box open and seize its contents.
    They don't even need to seize the contents - they might just snap a photo of your
    Seed Phrase and restore your wallet when they got off work.
    <br/><br/>
    The passphrase protects you in situations like this.
</div>

<h3>How to Secure your Passphrase</h3>
<p>
    Your Passphrase may be stored <i>digitally</i> using a password manager like LastPass or
    1Password. <b>NEVER STORE YOUR PASSPHRASE WITH YOUR SEED PHRASE!</b>
</p>
<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    If someone is able to obtain your Passphrase, it's pretty worthless unless they also know the
    entire seed phrase. This is why you should never store your Seed Phrase and your Passphrase
    together.
</p>

<h2>Create and Secure a PIN for your Hardware Wallet</h2>
<p>
    Every hardware wallet requires a PIN. You should choose a 6-digit PIN (or longer if possible) that you must enter
    to access coins in your crypto hardware wallet.
</p>
<p>
    You may need to enter your PIN several times when performing operations with your wallet.
</p>
<h3>How to Secure your PIN</h3>
<p>
    Your PIN may also be stored <i>digitally</i> using a password manager like LastPass or
    1Password. You should <b>NOT</b> write down your PIN.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-30/05-pin-398x599.jpg" alt="Protect your hardware wallet with a PIN"/>
    <figcaption>
        A PIN will protect your initialized hardware device.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    Anyone who has physical access to your active hardware wallet can access and remove your
    funds if they know your PIN. This is why it should be safe to keep it stored in a cloud-based
    password manager. Hackers from half-way around the world wouldn't be a threat to being able
    to connect your hardware wallet to their USB port, so storing your PIN in the cloud is just
    fine.
</p>
<p>
    It's crucial to understand that a PIN <i>ONLY</i> protects you if your physical hardware
    wallet falls into the wrong hands. If a bad actor knows your seed phrase and your Passphrase
    (assuming that you've set this), then they can re-create your wallet without ever knowing your
    PIN.

<h2>Additional Tips for Securing and Protecting Your Hardware Wallet</h2>
<p>
    Along with the three above <i>critical</i> security measures, there are additional tactics you
    can use to keep your crypto safe.
</p>

<h3>Use a Decoy (Non-Hidden) Wallet</h3>
<h4>Protects from $5 Wrench Attack</h4>
<p>
    If you use a Passphrase, if someone found your full 24-Word Seed Phrase and attempted
    to recover your wallet, they would see it would be empty. If they knew about
    Passphrase security, they might go through the efforts of trying to find out your Passphrase.
    A common low-tech tactic for getting someone to give up a password or passphrase is through
    what's called a "$5 Wrench Attack".
</p>
<p>
    Imagine a scenario where home invaders (who know you have crypto) tie you up and break
    open your safe. In your safe, they find a sheet of paper with your 24-Word phrase. Being
    knowledgable about crypto, they restore the phrase and find a wallet with no crypto.
</p>
<p>
    Since they know your Seed Phrase is valid, they might use physical force (e.g. a $5 wrench)
    to get you to surrender the Passphrase, which would allow them to access all your crypto.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-30/06-decoy-1024x683.jpg" alt="Decoys work with Crypto Wallets, too!"/>
    <figcaption>
        If you have a fake/decoy wallet with a small fraction of your fortune in it, it could
        save you from financial ruin as well as physical harm.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    But if you put a fraction of your crypto (perhaps 1% to 5%) in the main wallet associated with
    your 24-Word Seed Phrase, then when they recover the wallet, they may believe they found
    your main stash. They may not go through the extra effort of trying to find your Passphrase
    if they think they already hit the jackpot.
</p>

<h3>Don't Write Your Seed Phrase in the Correct Order</h3>
<h4>Protects Seed Phrase</h4>
<p>
    In the classic 1981 film <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, Nazis were able to copy the
    instructions for creating the <b>Staff of Ra</b>, a device used in a special map
    room to help pin point the location of the prized Ark of the Covenant. But the Nazis only
    copied part of the instructions and didn't have an important piece of the puzzle (the back
    side of Ravenwood's medallion) which said to cut part of the staff.
</p>
<p>
    You can do something similar with your 24-Word Seed Phrase. Write it down in order
    with one or two words reversed in order or replaced. Then in a password manager, include
    instructions on what changes to make when restoring the wallet. If a thief finds
    the physical copy of your seed phrase, when they try to restore your wallet, they'll
    be "digging in the wrong place!" Bonus points if you spinkle some cyrpto-dust into
    the decoy wallet.

<h3>Use a Decoy PIN</h3>
<h4>Accelerates "Self-Destruct" Mechanism for Hardware Wallet</h4>
<p>
    It's a pretty common tactic to write a fake PIN on your bank's ATM card. If your card
    is lost or stolen, a thief might try to use your card and withdraw funds. But if you
    write a fake PIN on your card, the thief could try to use it, and after several failed
    attempts to access your account, your card would be automatically locked in accordance
    with bank security policy.
</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-30/07-decoy-pin-800x449.jpg" alt="Crypto wallets will reset after a certain number of failed attempts."/>
    <figcaption>
        A decoy PIN can increase the liklihood that a thief can't access your hardware wallet. 
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You might write down a fake or invalid PIN somewhere near your physical hardware wallet.
    If you do this, write down the longest number that is still valid as a PIN length for your
    device. And make sure you make a few of the numbers ambiguous (Is that a '1' or a '7'? Is
    that a '6' or a '0'?). You can also write several different fake PINs to add to the
    confusion.
</p>
<p>
    Most hardware wallets make you wait a while between PIN entries, with your wait time
    growing exponentially longer between unsuccessful attempts. Also, there is usually an
    upper limit to attempts, with the device wipiing itself when the user makes too many
    bad attempts in a row. A decoy PIN can help accelerate the activation of this self-destruct
    mechanism.
</p>

<h3>Completely Wipe your Hardware Wallet</h3>
<h4>Eliminates need for PIN</h4>
<p>
    If you don't plan on moving any crypto out of your wallet for a long time, you can completely
    reset the hardware wallet and wipe the Seed Phrase and Passphrase from it.
</p>
<p>
    Your crypto will still exist, preserved by the blockchain. You can even move <i>more</i> crypto
    into your existing addresses without needing to restore your wallet on the device. So long as
    you know your destination addresses, you can continue stacking coins in your wallets.
</p>
<p>
    You just need to make sure you have your Seed Phrase and Passphrase safely and securely
    recorded. There is no need to remember your PIN, because when you set up a new hardware wallet,
    it will ask you for a new one.
</p>

<h3>Use Two Hardware Wallets</h3>
<h4>Reduces Likelihood of Bricked Hardware Wallet</h4>
<p>
    I've never bought a hardware wallet without buying a duplicate of the same model. Having two
    identical models allows you to practice doing several things without fear of losing all your
    coins.
</p>

<h4>Practice Restoring your Wallet to a Backup Wallet</h4>
<p>
    If you want to be confident that you can recover your wallet, you can restore your Seed Phrase
    to a second device to verify that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You know how to restore your seed phrase.
    </li>
    <li>
        You've recorded your seed phrase correctly.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform a "Dry Run" Firmware Upgrade</h4>
<p>
    When the manufacturer of your hardware wallet publishes a new version of it's firmware (the
    software that runs on your hardware), you can install it to your backup hardware wallet first.
</p>
<p>
    This can help ensure that the firmware update won't accidentally wipe your device and take
    all your coins along with it.
</p>
<p>
    This is just a slight inconvenience if you're storing your Seed Phrase and Passphrase
    securely, but if you've made any mistakes recording them, your coins could be unrecoverable
    from a firmware update.
</p>

<h2>Coming Up</h2>
<p>
    There are dozens, if not <i>hundreds</i> of other measures you can follow to help improve the
    security if your hardware wallet and its contents.
</p>
<p>
    We're even going to show you a cheap, easy, and super secure way of storing your Seed Phrase!
    No need to buy an expensive metal wallet!
