    I've created <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jackacestudios/sets" target="_blank">audio flashcards</a>
    for Blackjack.
    <br/>
    I've created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tis_YoGzSOk&list=PLf7_Bpai9n_0Kxy1s0MX7wvOE94EZGbnV" target="_blank">video flashcards</a>
    for Blackjack.
    <br/>
    I've even created an
    <a href="https://www.jackace.com/blog/2022/01/15/Blackjack-Flashcards-on-Alexa/">Alexa skill</a>
    so you can learn Blackjack Basic Strategy <i>hands free</i>!
</p>
<p>
    But what if I told you that you could learn Blackjack Basic Strategy...<b>FROM A BUSINESS CARD</b>?
</p>

<div class="infobox-info">
    I've run out of supplies for this promotion! Thanks, everyone for participating! I hope to make
    another batch in the future, so stay tuned!

<h3>Why Create these Cards?</h3>
<p>
    I'm visiting a few casinos this month and I'm going to see which ones are "vlogger-friendly" so that I
    can record real live action content for my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceDotCom?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> and
    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jackace.com" target="_blank">TikTok</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I thought it would be a great idea to bring some memorable business cards to demonstrate that I'm a
    legit content creator.
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to show how my content was focused on helping players gamble smarter. I've
    always wanted to have pre-printed Blackjack Basic Strategy cards that I could hand out to people and
    fans. So including a Basic Strategy chart on my business cards seemed like a perfect fit!
</p>

<p>
    <div class="infobox-info">

        I'll send you 5 business cards for free! (while supplies last)

<h3>Why Use SIMPLIFIED Basic Strategy?</h3>
<p>
    One decision I had to make was "Which Basic Strategy Chart do I Print?" My site has 6 full Basic Strategy
    charts - They cover 1, 2, and 4+ decks, and they cover Hitting and Standing on a Soft 17. That's 6
    different combinations in total.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of printing 6 different types of Basic Strategy charts, I thought a great compromise would be to
    just use the <a href="https://youtu.be/PfTWmpqHKnE" target="_blank">Simplified Basic Strategy" chart</a>
    showcased in my latest video!
</p>
<p>
    Simplified Basic Strategy is a culled down version of the True
    <a href="https://www.jackace.com/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/" target="_blank">Basic Strategy charts</a>
    that can be found on my website.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/basics/#wizards-simple-strategy">This chart</a>
    has been fine tuned by
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheOddsMustBeCrazy" target="_blank">Michael Shackleford</a>,
    aka <i>"The Wizard of Odds"</i> and the differences between the streamlined version and the optimal version
    only costs the player around 0.14% of expected value.
</p>

<h3>Why are some Decisions INCORRECT???</h3>
<p>
    Since the decisions are <i>simplified</i>, that means that you're not always making the optimal play.
    Instead of remembering that you hit a Hard 12 versus a dealer 2 and 3, the <i>simplified</i> set of
    rules says you <b>ALWAYS</b> stand on a stiff hand versus a dealer's low card (2-6).
</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-09-13-business-cards/20-true-vs-simplified-800.png" alt="TRUE Basic Strategy versus SIMPLIFIED Basic Strategy" />
    <figcaption>
        You can memorize 2 things instead of 50 with Simplified Basic Strategy, and the cost to your
        incorrect plays is only a few pennies for every dollar you bet.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    By doing this, we've reduced 50 decisions down to just 2 simple rules.
</p>
<p>
    And of the 50 decisions, there are only 2 incorrect plays, which each have very small changes to the
    overall expected house advantage. You can watch
    <a href="https://youtu.be/PfTWmpqHKnE" target="_blank">this video</a> for more details, but the short
    version of the story is that you sacrifice a <i>few really close plays</i> in exchange for having to
    learn some of the finer points of Basic Strategy.
</p>
<p>
    As I mentioned earlier, the cost of all these generalized rules <i>only</i> costs the player 0.14% in
    expected value. That means for every $10,000 you bet using this strategy, you will only be down $14
    more than someone playing <i>PERFECT</i> Basic Strategy.
</p>
<p>
    And this is the reason why I chose to use this simplified version of Basic Strategy for my business cards.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2023-09-13-business-cards/40-full-basic-strategy-464.png" alt="The FULL Basic Strategy (not including Insurance)" />
    <figcaption>
        This is the full chart of 270/280+ decisions you need to memorize to learn the FULL Basic Strategy.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    It doesn't try to be perfect, and it can be used for any 3:2 Blackjack game (don't ever play
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnb9gMFc5wM" target="_blank">6:5 Blackjack</a>).
    Admittedly, it's not perfect, but after over a <i>YEAR</i> of trying to get people to learn
    <b>TRUE</b> Basic Strategy, it's become apparent that people just don't have the time or patience to
    learn the 280+ decisions needed to master it.
</p>
<p>
    Even though this simplified strategy is <i>PRINTED</i> and should be readily available, I really
    feel that the <i>SIMPLIFIED</i> version is more likely to be used and memorized because it's less
    intimidating.
</p>
<p>
    Sure, I could have printed the <b>FULL</b> Blackjack Basic Strategy chart...but those charts
    already exist. If someone interested in learning Blackjack hasn't already spent $6 to buy one
    of these cards on their own, I doubt putting it on my business card will do any good for them.
