    Using flashcards is one of the best ways to master learning, whether it be for
    studying for the SAT, learning a new language, or just learning your
    times tables.
</p>
<p>
    The same can be said for memorizing Blackjack Basic Strategy.
</p>

<p>
    When I learned Basic Strategy over 30 years ago, I scribbled down the 250+
    Basic Strategy decisions onto index cards and flipped them over one-by-one until
    I had all of the answers down pat.
</p>
<h2>Introducing Blackjack Basic Strategy Video Flashcards</h2>
<p>
    With the invention of smartphones, you now have <i>multiple</i> options when it comes
    to rote memorization.
</p>
<p>
    Not only can you listen to a Soundcloud audio playist to help you
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/05/Learn-Blackjack-in-your-Sleep/">learn
    Blackjack in your sleep</a>, but now you can learn Basic Strategy by simply
    watching videos on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceDotCom?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I've created over 300 short videos (around 10 seconds each) that you can shuffle to help
    learn Blackjack Basic Strategy. Each track corresponds to a specific player versus dealer
    scenario that you might find on a
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/charts/MD_S17/">Blackjack
    Basic Strategy chart</a> (e.g. "Soft 15 (A-4) versus Dealer 4"). The track will present the
    player's hand and dealer's upcard, and reveal the proper action (Hit, Stand, Double,
    Split, or Surrender) shortly afterwards. Treat each track like a pop-quiz and you
    can learn all 250+ decisions in no time!
</p>
<p>
    There are 6 playlists that are separated according to the house rules you want to play
    against. Just select the playlist that best suits your needs and hit shuffle to listen to
    each track in random order.
</p>

    Here's a sample of the 4+ Deck/Stand on Soft 17 playlist:

<h2>What if You Count Cards?</h2>
<p>
    If you are a card counter who uses the High Low system, I've even made a playlist for the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unTsfxCbfcM&list=PLf7_Bpai9n_04hdn8YkZq9pT0UMYS7gsQ">Illustrious
    18 and Fab 4 Surrender deviations</a>.
</p>

<h2>Other Flashcard Resources</h2>
<p>
    If <i>video</i> flashcards aren't your cup of tea, make sure you check out the
    <i>audio</i> flashcards I've uploaded to
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jackacestudios/sets">Soundcloud</a>.
    Play them on shuffle in your car or on the plane ride to Vegas!
</p>

<h2>If you Play Blackjack, You Should Master Basic Strategy!</h2>
<p>
    Different methods of learning work differently for everyone. This type of learning may not
    work for <i>everyone</i>, but hopefully, it works for <i>you</i>!
</p>
<p>
    Once you've mastered Basic Strategy, you'll be playing almost <i>even</i> with the house.
    Under most Las Vegas casino rules, their advantage is under 0.5%. That's less than 1/10th of the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/29/The-Basics-of-Roulette-Math/">house advantage of Roulette</a>.
</p>
<p>
    And once playing perfect Basic Strategy becomes second nature, you can move on to card counting
    and becoming an <i>Advantage Player</i>! Basic Strategy is the foundation of all card counting
    systems, as you will rely on it for the vast majority of decisions.
