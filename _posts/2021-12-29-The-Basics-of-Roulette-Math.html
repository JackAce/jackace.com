<p>
    Have you ever wanted to learn the basics of Roulette math in just a few minutes? <b>No?</b> Well,
    too bad, because I'm going to teach them to you anyway! The good news for you is that the basics
    are dead simple, and I promise it'll be painless.
</p>

<h2>Eyeballing Payouts</h2>
<p>
    If you're starting your Roulette education from scratch, the first thing you'll need to learn 
    is the payouts for the various bets. You can wager on 1 to up to 18 numbers on a single bet and
    each wager pays out at different odds depending on your chances of winning.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, it's easy to figure out the payouts of each of these bets, and you don't need to memorize
    a big table or learn a complicated formula. For almost <i>all</i> of the bets, you can determine the
    payout by eyeballing the layout and slicing and dicing it visually.
</p>
<p>
    The trick is knowing that there is <i>NO</i> house advantage (a.k.a "house edge") in Roulette if we
    remove the zeroes
    (<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="0 Green" /> 
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="00 Green" />).
    That means that if you were to make the same bet multiple times until you've bet on all the numbers that
    aren't <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="0 Green" /> 
    or <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="00 Green" />,
    then your winning bets would be paid off by all of your losing bets, leaving you with no gain and no
    loss.
</p>
<p>
    To figure out how much each bet pays out, just keep making the same type of bet until you've bet
    on all 36 numbers and recognize that the number of losing bets is what your payout would need to be
    to pay off the winning bet. We're also going to pretend (in this payout calculation section) that
    we're dealing with a special Roulette wheel that doesn't contain Zeroes.
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind that there's <i>NO</i> reason to ever bet on all 36 numbers, since there's no chance of
    making money on the aggregate bets. We're just doing it here hypothetically to make our calculation
    simple.
</p>
<h3>1 Number Bet: "Straight-Up"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-01-straight-up-601x291.png" alt="35 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>35 losing bets pay the winning bet (35:1). The green background represents the potential winning spin and the red
    background represents the losing bets that would be needed to pay off the winning bet.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    There are 36 non-zero numbers, so if you bet on all 36 "Straight-Up" bets, your spin will have one
    winner (again, we're assuming no zeroes) and 35 losers. For there to be no house advantage with 
    our zeroless wheel, the Straight-Up bet needs to pay 35 to 1.
</p>
<h3>2 Number Bet: "Split"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-02-split-601x291.png" alt="17 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>17 losing bets pay the winning bet (17:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You can make 18 "Split" bets to cover up the entire non-zero field. For the Split bet scenario, you
    have to make sure there is no "overlap" in your bets, where hitting a single number would result in
    more than one Split bet winning.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-02a-split-overlap-601x291.png" alt="Two Split bets that overlap and win when the 1 hits" />
    <figcaption>Two Split bets that overlap and both win when the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> hits</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    The 17 losing bets will pay off the winning bet, so the 2-number bet pays 17 to 1. It's possible for
    Split bets to overlap, so make sure your bets are evenly
    distributed.
</p>
<h3>3 Number Bet: "Street"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-03-street-601x291.png" alt="11 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>11 losing bets pay the winning bet (11:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You can bet on all 12 "Streets" (each street is a row on the layout), and the 11 losing bets will pay off the
    one winner at a rate of 11 to 1.
</p>
<h3>4 Number Bet: "Corner"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-04-corner-601x291.png" alt="8 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>The 4-number bets along the top (the red striped regions) are not valid Corner bets, but are included here to illustrate coverage of the table</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    This one is a little tricky, because you kind of have to <i>warp</i> the definition of a "Corner" bet.
    You can't cover all 36 numbers exclusively with Corner bets without having <i>some</i> overlap of some
    of the numbers.
</p>
<p>
    There wouldn't be an issue with a casino allowing some type of "a-la-carte" 4-number bet where all four
    numbers were in a straight line (for example, if you could make a 4-number bet on the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/9_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="9 Red" />, &amp;
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/12_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="12 Red" />),
    the problem is with the game's layout. There's no area on the felt where you could place a chip
    and it would unambiguously identify which 4 spots you wanted to bet on. It would most
    likely just look like you were trying to make a 2-number split bet.
</p>
<p>
    But if you <i>could</i> make 4-number bets in the hypothetical betting scheme above,
    the 8 losing bets would pay off the winning bet at 8 to 1.
</p>
<h3>5 Number Bet: "Basket"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-05-basket-601x291.png" alt="The 5-number 'Basket' bet can not evenly split up the 36 number field" />
    <figcaption>The 5-number 'Basket' bet can not evenly split up the 36 number field</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    We're going to skip this bet for now. The five-number "Basket" bet is only possible by betting on
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="0 Green" /> ,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="00 Green" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />, and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />, which
    isn't going to be possible with our zeroless wheel.
</p>
<p>
    It's also the only bet that can't evenly split the 36 number field (since 36 is not evenly divisible by 5)
    and consequently, it's the only bet that doesn't offer fair odds on our mythical non-zero layout.
</p>
<h3>6 Number Bet: "Double-Street"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-06-double-street-601x291.png" alt="5 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>5 losing bets pay the winning bet (5:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Pays 5 to 1. Hopefully, you've figured out how this works by now.
</p>
<h3>12 Number Bet: "Dozen" or "Column"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-12-dozen-601x291.png" alt="2 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>2 losing bets pay the winning bet (2:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Pays 2 to 1.
</p>
<h3>18 Number Bet: "Red"/"Black", "Even"/"Odd", "1st Half"/"2nd Half"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-29/roulette-18-even-money-601x291.png" alt="Losing bet pays the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>Losing bet pays the winning bet (1:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Pays 1 to 1 (even money).
</p>

<h2>The Payout Formula</h2>
<p>
    If you're not a visual person like me and you <i>don't</i> want to visualize the Roulette betting layout
    every time you want to calculate the payouts, you can just use the following formula:
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \begin{align}
    { Payout_{n-number-bet} } = { {36 \over n } - 1 } \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    This should be easy to understand because it's the formulaic representation of the slicing and dicing
    we saw above.
</p>
<p>
    We took the 36 number layout, divided it by the number of spots we want to bet on at a time (<i>n</i>)
    and then subtracted the 1 winning bet to see how many losing bets we need to pay off the winner.
</p>
<p>
    For you non-visual learners, here's a table with all the calculations you need to determine the
    payouts:

<h2>Calculating the House Advantage</h2>
<p>
    Since we know that a zeroless Roulette wheel has no house advantage
    (for all bets besides the 5-number bet), we can simply calculate the
    house edge by calculating the probability of hitting any of the zeroes
    on the wheel.
</p>
<table class="condensed-table">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Wheel Type

<h2>That Pesky 5-Number "Basket" Bet</h2>
<p>
    To calculate the house advantage of <i>any</i> bet, you can use the more generic formula:
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \begin{align}
    { Advantage_{n-number-bet} } & = { { 36 - n - (n \times p) + z } \over { 36 + z } }
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Where <i>n</i> is the number of spots covered, <i>p</i> is the payout for the n-number bet, and
    <i>z</i> is the number of zeroes on the wheel.
</p>
<p>
    For all the bets we've covered so far, the \(\color{#8acdd8}36 - n - (n \times p)\) portion of the
    formula was always equal to 0. This is why there is no house edge in a zeroless wheel.
</p>
<p>
    But since the number 5 doesn't divide evenly into 36, it's not possible to have a fair payout that is a nice
    round number. That's why casinos short-change you on the payout of this bet by only paying you 6-to-1 instead
    of 6.2-to-1, making the 5-number bet the <i>persona non grata</i> of Roulette bets.
</p>
<p>
    To calculate the house advantage of the Basket bet on the Double Zero wheel, we get
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \begin{align}
    { Advantage_{basket} } & = { { 36 - 5 - (5 \times 6) + 2 } \over { 36 + 2 } } \\
    \\
    & = { { 36 - 5 - 30 + 2 } \over 38 } \\
    \\
    & = { 3 \over 38 } \\
    \\
    & = 7.89\% \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Here is the house edge on the 5-number bet for the various wheel configurations:
</p>
<table class="condensed-table">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Wheel Type
        </th>
        <th>

        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    The Basket bet is truly the <i>WORST</i> bet available on one of the worst table games.
    So, if you ever find yourself betting the Basket, you should ask yourself this question:

<h2>Comparing Roulette to Other Table Games</h2>
<p>
    So, now you know the house advantage for Roulette. In the US (where Double Zero wheels are the norm),
    it's 5.26% per bet and that is <b>HUGE</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The house edge for 6-deck Blackjack is only about 0.42% if you play perfect
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/">Basic Strategy</a>,
    making Roulette <b>12 and a half times worse</b>!
</p>
<p>
    And here's how Roulette stacks up against the most popular casino table games.
</p>

<table class="condensed-table">

<p>
    Roulette doesn't have as many events (i.e. spins) per hour as the other table games, but even with
    this factor working to the player's benefit, the hourly loss for the game is horrendous.
</p>
<p>
    In Blackjack, betting $10/hand at 105 hands/hour
    (<a href="https://wizardofodds.com/ask-the-wizard/136/">an estimate</a>
    for a table with 3 players) with a house edge of 0.42%, your hourly loss is about
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \( \$10/hand \times 105 {hands \over hour} \times 0.42\% = $4.41/hour\)
</p>
<p>
    In Roulette, betting $10/spin at 60 spins/hour (again,
    <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/ask-the-wizard/136/">estimating</a> for a 3 player table) with
    a house edge of 5.26%, your hourly loss is about
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \( \$10/hand \times 60 {hands \over hour} \times 5.26\% = \color{red}{$31.56/hour}\)

<h2>You're Now a Roulette Math Expert!</h2>
<p>
    Congratulations! You now know about 99% of what you need to know about Roulette Math!
</p>
<p>
    There's really not a lot to this game and I think the people who enjoy it are drawn in by its simplicity.
    Of course, casinos recognize this and it is their reason for charging patrons with an <i>EXORBITANT</i>
    house advantage of 5.26%.

<p>
    Now that you're an expert, hopefully you recognize that Roulette is one of the absolute
    <i>WORST</i> games out there. And if you're looking to interpret any of the numbers we've calculated

    If you <i>must</i> play Roulette, try to play a Single Zero game.<br/>
    If you can't find or afford a Single Zero game <i>NEVER</i> play a Triple Zero game.<br/>
    And no matter what, <i>NEVER</i> play the 5-number Basket bet.<br/>
