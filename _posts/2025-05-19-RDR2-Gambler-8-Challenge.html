<h2>
    Complete the RDR2 Gambler 8 Challenge without Losing your Mind
</h2>
<p>
    If you've stumbled upon Gambler Challenge #8 in Red Dead Redemption 2,
    congratulations‚Äîyou're now locked into one of the most rage-inducing
    minigame objectives in the entire campaign:
</p>
<blockquote>
    ‚ÄúWin 3 hands of Blackjack with 3 hits or more.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<p>
    Sounds simple, right? Just hit your hand three times and win. But Blackjack's
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/">Basic Strategy</a>
    isn't always your friend.
</p>
<p>
    I've heard from <b>LOTS</b> of people spending 4 or 5 hours trying to clear
    this achivement without even making <b>ONE</b> qualifying hand. With my tips,
    you should be able to complete the challenge in FULL in 3 hours.
</p>
<p>
    This challenge doesn't care if you're good at blackjack‚Äîit cares if you're lucky,
    patient, and willing to embrace a level of self-loathing normally reserved for
    taming wild horses in thunderstorms.
</p>

<p>
    I spent about two and a half hours grinding this one out, and while I was recording
    footage for my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceDotCom?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>,
    a couple of incendiary moments stood out...and I'm not talking about crafted ammo here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        First fail? Five-card 21...the Dealer <b>PUSHED</b>! I nearly threw my
        cowboy hat at the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        One time I hit and landed on a three-card soft 21. The game auto-stood for me. I
        would have gladly hit again and destroyed my perfect hand just to try to still
        go for a 5-Card Charlie, but Rockstar said ‚Äúnope.‚Äù
    </li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>It was frustrating to NOT be able to hit this soft hand!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    But good news: <b>I did it.</b> And I'm here to spare you a lot of heartache. Here's how.
</p>
<h3>
    üéØ The Goal Isn't to Beat Blackjack‚ÄîIt's to Win Stupidly
</h3>
<p>
    Forget 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/">Basic Strategy</a>.
    Forget maximizing EV. You're not here to play blackjack.
    You're here to force a win after hitting three times, which pretty much goes
    against the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/">Basic Strategy</a>
    rules.
</p>
<p>
    Here's what worked for me:
</p>
<h3>
    üí∞ Come Loaded
</h3>
<p>
    Try to bring at least $10. You probably won't lose anything close to that much, but this
    gives you hundreds of minimum bets to work with. Just don't show up with 10¬¢ and expect
    to survive.
</p>
<h3>
    ü™ë Sit at First Base
</h3>
<p>
    Try to find an empty table. If you can't, that's ok. But <b>ALWAYS</b> sit at first base.
    First base it the seat at the rightmost position at the table when you're facing the 
    dealer.
</p>
<p>
    If this seat is not available, then save your game and reload
    and check for that seat to be empty again.
</p>

    <figcaption>"First Base" is the betting circle to the dealer's left side</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You want to sit here because this seat is first to act. This lets you get in and out
    of hands faster, and lets you reset without waiting for NPCs to finish playing their
    hands.
</p>
<h3>
    üé≤ Always Bet the Minimum
</h3>
<p>
    This is a volume game, not a value game. Betting the minimum gives you maximum
    attempts to make a three-hit hand. <b>Bet 2¬¢.</b>
</p>
<h3>
    üõë Leave Hands You Don't Like
</h3>
<p>
    Here's the trick most players miss:
</p>
<p>
    If your first or second card gives you a bad total, stand up, turn around, and
    immediately sit back down to force a new hand. Yes, you'll lose your bet.
    Doesn't matter.
</p>
<p>    
    You'll want to decide your personal limits, but here's what worked for me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>1 card:</b> Quit if your total is 8 or higher.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>2 cards:</b> Quit if your total is 13 or higher.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>3 cards:</b> Quit if your total is 17 or higher.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>4 cards:</b> Hit anything under 21.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>5 cards:</b>
        If you <i>SOMEHOW</i> still have 11 or less, then hit.
        Otherwise, just stand. It doesn't matter what the dealer
        has showing.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Abandoning a hand, sitting back down, making your next bet, and
    getting the first card of your next hand can take about <i>20 seconds</i>,
    assuming you're quick enough to re-enter the game before the dealer deals
    the NPCs their next hand. That sounds like a long time, but waiting for
    the NPCs to continue playing your doomed hand can take 
    <i>several agonizing minutes</i>, depending on how many other seated players
    there are and how the cards they receive.
</p>
<p>    
    If you would rather take your chances with your three-card 19 for the 
    <b>1/169</b> chance that you'll get <b>back-to-back Aces</b>, then go ahead and
    try your luck. You can decide how much you want to leave up to chance
    and how much you want to just start anew.
</p>
<h3>
    üö´ No Doubles, No Splits, No Insurance
</h3>
<p>    
    Every other option at the table is a distraction. Your only goal is
    to hit three times and somehow not bust. That's it.
</p>
<p>    
    I've heard conflicting stories about whether you can split and then
    receive 4 cards on a split hand to qualify. I haven't been able to confrirm
    it either way. To be safe, just don't split. If it's a low total hand, it's
    best to play anyway. If it's a high total hand, it's best to just leave the
    table and return. So it's not really in your best interest to split.
</p>
<h3>
    ‚úåÔ∏è When to Stand
</h3>
<p>    
    Once you've drawn five cards and haven't busted‚Äîstand. That's your shot.
    Pray the dealer bricks.
</p>
<p>    
    You <i>should</i> hit if you have five cards <i>AND</i> your total is 11
    or less. But that's incredibly unlikely to happen.
</p>
<p>    
    You're not trying to beat the house consistently‚Äîyou just need to get lucky
    three times. And the odds are brutal. So reset. Reboot. Laugh. Cry. Repeat.
</p>
<h3>

</h3>

    get to watch my descent into madness in real time.

    If you thought hunting
    <a href="https://shop.jackace.com/products/snow-egrets-rdr2-unisex-classic-tee" target="_blank">Snow Egrets</a>
    was annoying, just wait until you're praying
    for three 2s in a row while the dealer flips a perfect 21.
</p>
<p>
    But hey‚Äîit's worth it for <i>100% completion</i>, right?
