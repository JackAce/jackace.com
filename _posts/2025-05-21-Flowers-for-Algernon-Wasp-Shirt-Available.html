    If you've played Red Dead Redemption 2 long enough to start
    hallucinating herons, odds are you've crossed paths with one
    of the game's most eccentric side characters:
    <a href="https://shop.jackace.com/products/flowers-for-algernon-wasp-rdr2-unisex-classic-tee" target="_blank">Algernon Wasp</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The man, the myth, the monocled socialite.

    <figcaption>This man loves his Italian Contessas</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    He lives in <b>Saint Denis</b> surrounded by bone-china teacups,
    orchid arrangements, and an unsettling obsession with <i>bird
    plumes</i> and <i>gator eggs</i>. And you? You're his errand boy.
    Trudging through mosquito-infested wetlands, scaling cliffs for
    rare flowers, and chasing egrets through the muck like some kind
    of Victorian DoorDash courier for exotic fauna.
</p>
<p>
    All in the name of…<b>love</b>?
</p>

<p>
    That's right—Algernon's flamboyant (yet somehow oddly sincere)
    quest for exotic collectibles is all to impress the mysterious
    <b>Contessa</b>. Unfortunately for him, the Contessa ends up
    falling for a lowly postman instead. It's one of RDR2's great
    tragic arcs: a fop undone by the ineffable cruelty of unrequited
    love and USPS uniform appeal.
</p>
<p>
    It's funny. It's sad. It's a little gross.

    <figcaption>Have you collected all of Algernon's Sparrow's Egg Orchids?</figcaption>

<p>
    And it inspired a
    <a href="https://shop.jackace.com/products/flowers-for-algernon-wasp-rdr2-unisex-classic-tee" target="_blank">t-shirt</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Behold the <i>Flowers for Algernon Wasp</i> tee—our tribute to the
    feather-chasing, egg-hoarding, heartbreak-having soul of one of
    the game's most memorable free spirits.

    The design features a white lab mouse—an homage to
    <a href="https://amzn.to/43p2sG9" target="_blank">the book</a>
    and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210044/" target="_blank">TV series</a>
    <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>, which, if you've read it, you know
    is all about intelligence, identity, and inevitable loss. That
    mouse, Algernon, becomes a symbol of brief brilliance and
    the aching decline that follows.

<p>
    So yeah. Deep stuff. Perfectly balanced by the sheer absurdity
    of plundering a swamp for lady slippers while your cowboy boots
    rot from the ankles down.
</p>
<p>
    This shirt is for the <b>completionist</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>collector</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The swamp-slogging romantic who still believes in grand gestures,
    even if they involve pelican beaks and parasitic egg theft.
</p>
<p>
    Wear it proudly. Wear it ironically. Wear it while explaining to
    strangers why you once spent an hour trying to find a ghost orchid
    behind a waterfall during a thunderstorm.
