    On a recent episode of
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JAba7pJEow&t=2260s" target="_blank">"Ask Michael Anything"</a>,
    I asked the <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/" target="_blank">"Wizard of Odds"</a>
    (a.k.a Mike Shackleford) whether his Bitcoin withdrawal request was ever honored by
    Wixiplay Casino.
</p>

<p>
    I discussed his problems with Wixiplay in my
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/03/27/Not-Your-Keys-Not-Your-Coin/">last blog post</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Shackleford confirmed that the site never paid him.

        was never honored. The request was made over two years ago.

    Shady crypto sites are another reason why you should maintain control of your cryptocurrency
    keys. Always remember,

<p>
    Also, I
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JAba7pJEow?start=1693s">answered one of the Wizard's Peanuts Trivia Questions correctly</a>!
    The question was "What is Linus and Lucy's last name?"

    That last tidbit was neither gambling nor crypto related...just fanboying here... :)
