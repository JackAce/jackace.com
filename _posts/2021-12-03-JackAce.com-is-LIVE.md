I've owned the [jackace.com](https://jackace.com) domain name since 2002 and finally decided to do something with it after almost 20 years!

I'm excited to launch this site as a resource for donkeys like *YOU* who want to learn more about gambling and crypto (there's a *huge* overlap
with people that are interested in both!). My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JackAceDotCom?sub_confirmation=1) will be the main
source of content, and this site/blog will help supplement it.

I'm a big fan of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so I decided to use it as the backbone of the site! It uses
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for markup and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments. If you're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com)
and GitHub Pages, you already know that you can contribute to my site by making corrections or adding content and submitting a Pull Request.
This site's repo is [JackAce/jackace.com](https://github.com/JackAce/jackace.com).

This is the first of many posts, so stay tuned! If you'd like to read more about me, check out my [About page]({{site.baseurl}}/about).
