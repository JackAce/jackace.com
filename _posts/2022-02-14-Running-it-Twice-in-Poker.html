<p>
    Around 2006, an option for "Running it Twice" started to become popular on televised
    Poker cash games. It was becoming a regular occurrence on the show <i>High Stakes Poker</i> on GSN
    and several other cash game shows.
</p>
<p>
    But what affect does running it once, twice, or even <i>44 times</i> do to your expected result? How
    does it affect your variance?
</p>

<h2>What is "Running it Twice"?</h2>
<p>
    Two players can agree to "run it twice" when one of the players is all-in and there are
    still more cards to come. When the players agree to run it twice, they are agreeing to complete
    the hand with two sets of outcomes. If there is one card left to be dealt, then two separate River
    cards will be dealt, each card acting as a the final community card for two separate outcomes. The
    winner of each outcome will be entited to a half of the total pot.
</p>
<p>
    If you win both times, you win the entire pot. If you lose both times, you lose the entire pot.
    If you win one and lose the other, then the pot is divided in half and distributed amongst the two
    players.

<h3>What about Running it 3 or 4 times or even more?</h3>
<p>
    You can "run it" multiple times. Each time you run it, the pot shares become smaller and 
    smaller, and it becomes more likely that the underdog will get at least <i>some</i> of his money
    back.
</p>

<h2>How does Running it Multiple Times affect Your Expected Value (EV)?</h2>
<p>
    It doesn't.
</p>
<p>
    Your EV is exactly the same whether you run it once, twice, or even 44 times.
</p>

<h2>How does Running it Multiple Times affect Your Variance?</h2>
<p>
    The only statistical change that results from multiple run-outs is a lowering of
    variance. The more turns and rivers you see, the more your results will resemble
    the expected result and the lower the fluctuation to your bankroll.
</p>

<h2>Calculating the Results of Running it N Times</h2>
<p>
    Most seasoned poker players are already aware that running it multiple times
    results in <i>zero</i> change to your EV. But I've often heard noobs (incorrectly)
    say that running it multiple times is bad for the favorite in the situation, and that
    running it twice is good for the underdog's EV.
</p>
<p>
    We'll see why these people are incorrect by looking at a few examples.
</p>

<h3>1-outer on the River</h3>
<p>
    Let's take a look at an extreme situation.
</p>
<p>
    I think the best way to illustrate that the EV remains the same is to look at the case
    where the underdog has a one-outer with just the River to come.
</p>
<div class="poker-felt">
    <div class="poker-row">
        <div class="poker-hand">
            <div class="poker-hand-title">
                Favorite
            </div>
            {%- include card.html card="Ah" class="card-lg" -%}
            {%- include card.html card="Kh" class="card-lg" -%}
        </div>
        <div class="poker-hand">
            <div class="poker-hand-title">
                Underdog
            </div>
            {%- include card.html card="3h" class="card-lg" -%}
            {%- include card.html card="2h" class="card-lg" -%}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="poker-row">
        <div class="poker-hand">
            <div class="poker-hand-title">
                Board
            </div>
            {%- include card.html card="4h" class="card-lg" -%}
            {%- include card.html card="5h" class="card-lg" -%}
            {%- include card.html card="9c" class="card-lg" -%}
            {%- include card.html card="Jh" class="card-lg" -%}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Here, the Favorite has the nut-flush and the Underdog is drawing to a 
    {% include card.html card="6h" showImage=false %}.
</p>
<p>
    There are 44 unknown cards and only 1 card will make the underdog a winner.
    If the post were $44, then he'd have an EV of $1.
</p>
<p>
    <i>So let's run it 44 times!</i>
</p>
<p>
    To do this, we have to ignore burn cards and deal out all 44 River cards and
    make forty-four $1 pots.
</p>
<p>
    Since we already know the dog is drawing to a one-outer, we know exactly one
    of those $1 pots will have his 
    {% include card.html card="6h" showImage=false %}, netting him $1 and awarding the favorite
    $43.
</p>
<h3>What about Multiple Outs?</h3>
<p>
    And the same is true for any number of outs with just the River to come. If
    the dog is drawing to a flush against the favorite's top pair, we'd be looking
    at 9 outs.

<p>
    In our $44 pot situation, his EV would be $9, and if we ran it 44 times,
    he'd get back exactly that.
</p>
<p>
    It's pretty easy to see that if you run it 44 times, exhausting all undealt cards, then
    your number of outs will be exactly the number of mini-pots that you will win. So 2 outs
    means that you'll get 2/44 of the pot. 3 outs means 3/44. And if your opponent is drawing
    dead, then you'll win all 44 pots -- But more importantly, why the hell would you waste the
    dealer's time if he's drawing dead?
</p>
<p>
    The more times you "run it", the more your actual results will converge toward the expected
    value. In our extreme examples of running it 44 times, the actual result is <i>EXACTLY</i>
    your expected result and variance has been cut down to <i>ZERO</i>.
</p>

<h3>Running it 2 or 3 Times</h3>
<p>
    What if we live in the real world and we can't practically run it 44 times? Well, I guess
    it's time to break out some formulas.
</p>
<h3>Running it Twice with a 1-Outer on the River</h3>
<p>
    It might seem silly for a person with a 1-outer to run it twice, because there's <i>zero</i>
    chance he'll win both pots. In actuality, there's no net change to his EV and he might just
    be trying to increase his odds of getting <i>any</i> kind of cash back on his near hopeless
    situation. Chopping a pot can seem like a very favorable outcome when you need to hit your
    {%- include glossary-term.html term="case card" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    By running it twice, you're doubling your chances of getting money back, but the amount you
    receive will be halved.
</p>
<div class="infobox-info">
    One funny observation about running it twice with a one-outer is that if you end up getting
    what you want and you win one of the two hands, there's a 50% chance you'll be upset
    because you would have taken the whole pot on the first River if you just ran it once.
</div>
<p>
    The EV for running a 1-outer twice is still pretty easy:
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \begin{align}
    EV_{1{\text -}outer} & = { { P_{W1} \times P_{L2} } \over 2 } + { { P_{L1} \times P_{W2} } \over 2 } \\
    \\
    & = { { {1 \over 44 } \times {43 \over 43} } \over 2 } + { { {43 \over 44 } \times {1 \over 43} } \over 2 } \\
    \\
    & = { 2 \times {43 \over { 44 \times 43 } } \over 2 } \\
    \\
    & = {43 \over { 44 \times 43 } } \\
    \\
    & = {1 \over 44 } \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Where \(P_{W1}\) is the probability of winning the first pot, \(P_{W2}\) is the probability of winning the
    second pot, \(P_{L1}\) is the probability of losing the first pot, and \(P_{L2}\) is the probability of
    losing the second pot.
</p>
<p>
    And this is exactly the EV we saw when running it 44 times.
</p>
<h3>Running it Twice with a 2-Outer on the River</h3>
<p>
    This example is less trivial, and the formula is a little more complex. Here's how we calculate the
    EV of running it twice with a 2-outer (assuming runner-runner won't help us):
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \begin{align}
    EV_{2{\text -}outer} & = { { P_{W1} \times P_{L2} } \over 2 } + { { P_{L1} \times P_{W2} } \over 2 } + { P_{W1} \times P_{W2} }\\
    \\
    & = { { {2 \over 44 } \times {42 \over 43} } \over 2 } + { { {42 \over 44} \times {2 \over 43} } \over 2 } + { {2 \over 44 } \times {1 \over 43} }\\
    \\
    & = { { { { 2 \times 41 } \over { 44 \times 43 } } } \over 2 } + { { { { 42 \times 2 } \over { 44 \times 43} } } \over 2 } + {2 \over { 44 \times 43 } }\\
    \\
    & = { { 2 \times { { 2 \times 42 } \over { 44 \times 43 } } } \over 2 } + {2 \over { 44 \times 43 } } \\
    \\
    & = { {2 \times 42 } \over { 44 \times 43 } } + {2 \over { 44 \times 43 } } \\
    \\
    & = {86 \over { 44 \times 43 } } \\
    \\
    & = { { 2 \times 43 } \over { 44 \times 43 } } \\
    \\
    & = {2 \over 44} \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    And this is exactly the EV we saw when running it 44 times.
</p>

<h3>Running it n-Times with a z-Outer on the River</h3>
<p>
    Here's the general formula for calculating the EV of a z-outer with one card to come:
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \( \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n { { i \over n } {n \choose i} } { { {}_z \mathrm{ P }_i \times {}_{(44-z)} \mathrm{ P }_{(n-i)} } \over {}_{44} \mathrm{ P }_n }  \)
</p>
<p>
    Where n is the number of times you want to run the river (\(0 < n \le 44\)) and z is the number
    of outs (\(0 \le z \le 44\)). Here the "P"s are the operator for calculating Permutations, not
    determining probabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Breaking down this formula we can see that we are 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            \( \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \)
        </td>
        <td>
            Adding up each of the expected values of winning i number of pots from 1 to n.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            \( i \over n \)
        </td>
        <td>
            Multiplied by the share of the pot you would win
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            \( {n \choose i} \)
        </td>
        <td>
            Multiplied by combination of ways you could win that many pots
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            \( {}_z \mathrm{ P }_i \times {}_{(44-z)} \mathrm{ P }_{(n-i)} \)
        </td>
        <td>
            Multiplied by number of ways you win i pots and lose n-i pots
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            \( {}_{44} \mathrm{ P }_n \)
        </td>
        <td>
            Divided by the number of ways the n cards could be dealt
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    This even works for scenarios where you are able to eliminate dead cards and there are fewer than 44
    unknown cards.
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \( \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n { { i \over n } {n \choose i} } { { {}_z \mathrm{ P }_i \times {}_{(y-z)} \mathrm{ P }_{(n-i)} } \over {}_y \mathrm{ P }_n }  \)
</p>
<p>
    Where n is the number of times you want to run the river (\(0 < n \le y\)) and z is the number
    of outs (\(0 \le z \le y\)) and y is the number of undealt cards (\(z \le y \le 44\)).
</p>
<p>
    So plugging this into WolframAlpha, you can see that this sum always adds up to \( z \over 44 \)
    for all values of n.
</p>
<pre>
    Sum[(k/n)*C(n, k)*[ (P(z, k) * P(44-z, n-k))/P(44, n) ],{k,1,n}]
</pre>
