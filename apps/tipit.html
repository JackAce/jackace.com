<p>
    TipiT is our Palindromic Tip Calculator that helps cut down on fraud! Use TipiT to
    ensure that your credit card total is a palidromic amount that reads the same both
    backwards and forwards.
</p>
<p>
    When it comes time to reconcile your credit card statement, verifying your bar and
    restaurant charges can take seconds and doesn't have to involve paper receipts at all.
    Just make sure the amounts are in the right ballpark and that they read the same
    backwards and forwards. If they don't, it means a malicious server may have tinkered
    with your tip amount and your total.
