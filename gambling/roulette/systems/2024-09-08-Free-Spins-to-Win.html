title: Free Spins to Win - Roulette System Review

<p>
    I seriously don't understand what is supposed to happen with this system. They start out with a
    $20 bet, but then Alex jumps straight into a $30 bet, saying that is supposed to be the 2nd step.
</p>
<p>
    They're betting $10 on the 2nd Dozen, and then two x $5 Double Street bets that cover the same
    Dozen. Why not just put it all on the 2nd Dozen? This system is a mess.
</p>
<p>
    This is a modified D'Alembert system. I think you're supposed to add to the bets when you lose, and
    remove bets when you win.
</p>
<p>
    I'm just going to record the spins and show what I think they won or lost.
