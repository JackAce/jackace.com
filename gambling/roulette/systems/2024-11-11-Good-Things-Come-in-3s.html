title: Good Things Come in 3s - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This starts out with two Dozen bets, then launches into Triple Entry Max Climax.

<p>
    When you bet the 3 even money bets, if you win 1/3, then you drop down to two
    Dozen bets with the remaining money. If you win 2/3, press the winnings into
    two dozen bets. When you win 3/3, then start over at tier 1.

    I think this system is just too complicated with too many possibilites for each
    step and there's little opportunity to win big.
