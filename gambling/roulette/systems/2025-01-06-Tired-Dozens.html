title: Tired Dozens ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Multi-Leg" %}
    system where you bet on two dozens or columns.
</p>
<p>
    You start out with two $10 bets on two Dozens or two Columns.
    If you win, you press an additional $5. If you lose, you press
    $10. The two bets operate independently.

<p>
    You start out with two $10 bets on two Dozens or two Columns.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the contant pressing, you're going to end up in a
    "Tail Wagging the Dog" situation <i>EVERY TIME</i>. The large
    bets you make at the end will <b>ALWAYS</b> dictate how successful
    you are with this system. The first few spins won't really matter.
</p>
<p>
    Not just that, but it's going to be really difficult to keep track
    of your bets to figure out what your next bet is going to be. Definitely
    not DTF friendly.
