    Positive Progression system. When you win, press your winnings. After the first tier,
    one bet should be $10 more than the other.

    You can bet any two Dozens or any two Columns. You can flip back and forth if you desire.

    I really don't like these imbalanced dozen bets. There's just too much of a hedge and
    there's not really a good opportunity to win big.
