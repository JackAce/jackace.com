    This is a flat betting pattern that is similar to 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2020-08-13-Romanovsky" -%}.
    It adds some hedging and it adds another whack.

    I think Romanovsky is pretty scary to begin with. Adding more whacks to it
    makes it really treacherous.

    There were apparently two versions of the betting pattern. You can use either
    one.
