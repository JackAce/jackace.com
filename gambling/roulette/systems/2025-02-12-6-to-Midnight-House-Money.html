title: 6 to Midnight House Money ðŸ•› - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a pretty simple 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system where you go to the next tier when you win and retreat to 
    tier 1 when you lose. Stay at the same level if you PUSH (which will
    happen quite a lot).
</p>
<p>
    The premise of this system is that you get off to an early lead and
    parlay the wins to play with "House Money". Okay...
</p>
<p>
    There are WAAAAAY too many pushes with this system. It's really going
    to reduce your chances of achieving your win goals.
