title: 57% ðŸ¥§ - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system. It is also a Spectrum Progression system, where your win on a
    certain tier will put you on several different tiers, depending on
    the amount of the win.

<p>
    You supposedly have a 57% chance to win $100 using this system...according to
    the system author. I may verify this later.

    On tier 1, if you hit the Black (only), you push. If you hit the Red on your
    column, you win $50 and go to tier 3. If you hit both bets, you go to tier 2.

    Alex bought in 3 times (3 friends) and ended even for the session, although he
    should have been down $75 according to my estimates.

    Personally, I don't like the pushes...NO PUSHES! But this isn't a bad system.
    Also, I don't like the 10 number bet on tier 2. Too many bets. I'd rather bet $250
    on an Even Money bet.
