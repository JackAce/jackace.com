<p>
    This is a ladder system where you Fibonacci on a loss, and you go into a complicated
    positive progression when you win. For the Fibonacci sequence, it's 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 
    etc. where you add the last two bets. The base unit is $25 for this, so the sequence is
    25, 25, 50, 75, 125, 200, etc.

    For the Fibonacci sequence, I'm not going to provide the system bet images. You should
    just recognize that you're going to win 2x your bet.
</p>
<p>
    For the positive progression part, you bet $20 each on two overlapping Even money bets.

<p>
    And after that...you start adding column bets??? This system sucks.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=390 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=325 -%}.

<p>
    This system is too complex for anyone to realistically follow. And whatever it is
    trying to get you to do is just spreading your bets too thin.
