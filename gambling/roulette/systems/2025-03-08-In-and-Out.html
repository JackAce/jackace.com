<p>
    This is a  {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system. When you win, move on to the next tier. On the 4th tier, you reset to
    tier 1 whether you win or lose.

<p>
    The goal is to hit 4 in a row. 
</p>
<p>
    There was a bigger version of this system where you have 8 tiers, but Alex capped
    his wins at 4 tiers.
