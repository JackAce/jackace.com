title: The Winning System - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    You start with the $50/$50 bet on two dozens.
</p>
<p>
    When you hit on the first tier, you pull back the winning bet and try to win
    the other Dozen bet. If that bet loses, then start over.
</p>
<p>
    If you lose on the first tier, then keep pressing the two bets, going from
    $100 to $200, to $300, to $500, to $700. When you win on the negative progression, 
    then reset to tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    This is a very risky system that gets out of control pretty quickly.
