<p>
    This is also known as "All the Martingale" and "Martingale Gangbang"
</p>
<p>
    Pick 3 overlapaping even money bets and bet 1 unit each. Pick one dozen and one column and bet 1 unit each. Martingale when you lose.
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a Durian because it's too complicated to keep track of each bet and you only
    add to the risk of losing everything by martingaling all the bets independently.
</p>
<p>
    The typical Martingale system has three characteristics:
    <ul>
        <li>You win 1 unit when you win</li>
        <li>It's easy to bet</li>
        <li>You have a low probability of losing everything</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This system has the following characteristics
    <ul>
        <li>You win up to 7 units when you win</li>
        <li>It's NOT easy to bet</li>
        <li>You have a MUCH HIGHER probability of losing everything</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The negatives far outweigh the positives for me.
