<p>
    This is a very good low limit Positive Progression system! I would only change
    some of the bets to make them easier to bet.
</p>
<p>
    When you win, go to the next tier. Win or lose on the 3rd tier, reset to tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    For example for the first bet,
    I'd probably bet a Double Street and a Corner bet, instead of making 5 bets.
    For the 3rd tier, I'd just bet a Dozen or Column.
</p>
<p>
    Love the progressions here, but again, I'd make the bets simpler. My rating of the
    system assumes that you're playing on an ETG or you've simplified the bets.

    At the end of the trial, Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=208 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=209 -%}.
