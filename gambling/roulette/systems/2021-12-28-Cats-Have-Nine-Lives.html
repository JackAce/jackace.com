title: Cats Have Nine Lives - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a moronic 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Multi-Leg" %}
    system where you start out with bets on all 6 Dozen/Column
    bets.
</p>
<p>
    You keep betting the 12 number bets until they hit. When you hit
    your bet, then take it down. You start
    off with $10 on each bet, then increase to $20, then $40, then
    $60, then $80, then $110, then $160, then $240. Quit when you've
    hit all 6 bets.
</p>
<p>
    Don't bother making the first bet. When you step up to the table, 
    just note which dozen and column was hit and skip that bet. Just
    jump straight into tier 2. Betting on all 3 Dozens and all 3 Columns
    is idiotic.
