title: Double Street Sandwich ðŸ¥ªðŸ¥ª - Roulette System Review

<p>
    When you hit the BIG bet (the straight-up bets), you go to the next tier (add $90).
    When you lose, step back. If you hit the small bet, stay at the same tier.

<p>
    On the top tier, if you hit the big bet, you can reset.
</p>
<p>
    I don't think I'd add the Double Street bet. Try to consolidate your wins and
    hit something bigger.
