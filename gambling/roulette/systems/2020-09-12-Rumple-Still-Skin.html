    Pretty sure this should be named Rumple Stiltskin, but I'm just going off the title of the video.

    You could make a congruent system by betting $75 on 2 dozens.

        This system still has 14 whacks, and 24 $75 wins.

    I would change this system to have a smaller buy-in. $2500 is just too much and it doesn't even divide
    evenly for the bet size.
