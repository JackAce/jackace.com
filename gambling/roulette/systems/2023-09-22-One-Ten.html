    Alex was up $115 at the end, but he should have been up $140. In fact, there's no possible way he could
    have been up $115 given this betting pattern. Every win and loss ends with a 0, so his overall win
    should also end with a zero.

    About half-way through the video, Dennis suggested they change the streets that
    they bet in the 2nd dozen to the 13, 16, and 19 streets.

    This is a <b>MUCH</b>
    better way to play because it eliminates the bet nullification situation, although
    it opens up more WHACKS (which is fine).
