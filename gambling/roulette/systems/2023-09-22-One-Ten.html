    Alex was up $115 at the end, but he should have been up $140. In fact, there's no possible way he could
    have been up $115 given this betting pattern. Every win and loss ends with a 0, so his overall win
    should also end with a zero.

    About half-way through the video, Dennis suggested they change the streets that
    they bet in the 2nd dozen to the 13, 16, and 19 streets.

    This is illustrated in the 4th tier for this system.

    This is a <b>MUCH</b>
    better way to play because it eliminates the bet nullification situation, although
    it opens up more WHACKS (which is fine).
