<p>
    Martingale System. You make two bets on two dozens. One of the bets is the "constant", the other
    is a "floater". When you miss, move the floater to the most recent dozen. When 0/00 hit, then
    wait a spin. When you miss, you 4x Martingale. Walk when you're up $100.

    There is too much risk for such a small reward with this system. Not enough chance for a large
    payout with this system. Hence the poor score.
