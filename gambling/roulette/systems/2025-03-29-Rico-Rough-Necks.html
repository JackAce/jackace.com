<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Multi-Leg" %}
    system that uses a Ladder. There's a positive progression
    and a negative progression.
</p>
<p>
    When you win, press $10 on the winning bet until it loses. When a
    winning streak is broken by a loss, then reset to the single unit bet.
</p>
<p>
    When a bet loses, you're going to wait until it loses 3x. Then you
    go $15 then $20. The sequence is $10, $10, $10, $15, $20. When the losing
    streak is broken with a win, then reset to the single unit bet.
