title: No Lose Comp Collector - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    This is the <span class="amt-bad">ABSOLUTE WORST</span> system CEG has ever reviewed.
</p>
<p>
    You should
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/22/Bet-Nullification-in-Roulette/">never bet on more than 35 numbers at a time</a>
    and they are betting on all 38 numbers!
</p>
<p>
    You can remove the split bets and halve the remaining bets and MAKE $10 MORE THAN THIS
    SYSTEM ON EVERY SPIN.

    <figcaption>
        Using this betting pattern will save you $10 on <b>EVERY SPIN</b>. The wins increase from $10 to
        $20, and the losses decrease from -$170 to -$160.
