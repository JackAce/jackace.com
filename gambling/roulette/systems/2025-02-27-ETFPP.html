<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system. Move on to the next tier on a win. On the 3rd tier, always
    reset to step 1 whether you win or lose.

    Since we have this goofy ass $5 bet on tier 1, this knocks down the 
    comp value of the system. You'd be so much better off playing on a
    single zero wheel and getting rid of the smaller bets.
