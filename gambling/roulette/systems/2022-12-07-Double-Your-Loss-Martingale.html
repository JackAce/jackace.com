title: Double Your Loss Martingale - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This system was also known as "Risk vs. Reward".
</p>
<p>
    The system author claims to be up $40,000 using this system, but I have some doubts
    about that, given the escalation of this system. Seems like you'd go broke pretty
    quickly. But it's possible that the author hasn't hit a bad enough streak yet.
</p>
<p>
    "Double Your Loss Martingale". When you've lost, double the TOTAL amount lost and
    bet that.
</p>
<p>
    That <i>should</i> end up with you tripling your bet after a loss (starting at the
    $20 level), but I think the system author made some mods that that scheme.
</p>
<p>
    This is just a quicker way to lose your bankroll quicker than
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" -%}.
    Sure, you recover your losses and even come out with a faster profit when you
    eventually hit your number, but you're sure to hit the table limits  or the end of
    your bankroll quicker.

<p>
    These are all Even Money bets, so I only provided graphics for the first 2 tiers
    of this system.
