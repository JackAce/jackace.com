<p>
    This is a good positive progression system with lots of potential
    for a monster win. It starts off with parlayed Dozen/Column bets, 
    with a third tier bet where you can win up to $675. There are lots
    of mini-jackpots as well.

    Even though Alex got clapped, there is lots of good things about this
    system. Lots of potential. I'd just change the tier 3 bet to something
    simpler (while retaining the big jackpots).

    Here's an alternative betting pattern for tier 3.

    You can quit with success after a big score on tier 3.
