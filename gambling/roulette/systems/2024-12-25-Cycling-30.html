    Since this is a "Couple's System" where you're literally betting on
    ALL 6 EVEN MONEY BETS... This grade is an EASY
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="f" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.

    If you <i>must</i> play, do it in single player mode.

    When you win, remove the bet. When you lose, Martingale. You Martingale each
    bet independently, which make this system a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Multi-Leg" %} system.

<p>
    Reset when you clear the board. At this point, you'll be up 
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=30 -%}.

    As with <i>most</i>
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %} +
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Multi-Leg" %} systems, you add
    <i>MULTIPLE</i> single points of failure. The downfall of Martingale is that
    you will inevitably hit a run of bad luck that wipes you out. Here, you're
    <i>TRIPLING</i> the chances that you hit that bad streak.
