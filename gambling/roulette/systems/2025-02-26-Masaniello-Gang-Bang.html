title: Mansaniello Gang Bang - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is the
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Multi-Leg" %}
    version of 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2025-02-21-Masaniello" -%},
    which was a shitty system that received a 
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="d" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    from me and a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="c" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    from CEG.
</p>
<p>
    Why? Just why?
</p>
<p>
    Betting goes according to this chart:
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/systems/2025-02-26/01-masaniello-chart.png" alt="Masaniello Chart" />
    <figcaption>Start at the Upper Left Hand Cell. Move Right on Black. Move Down on Red.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You start on the upper-left hand corner and you start with a blank spin. If it's red/odd, then
    go down if it's black/even, go right. If you're right/above the diagonal, then bet Black/Even. If
    you're left/below the diagonal, bet Red/Odd. Multiply the number by your unit bet size.
</p>
<p>
    Don't play multi-leg systems. You're just adding multiple single points of failure to your system.
