    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Flat Bet" %}
    strategy. Bet $19 on
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="1" %} through {% include roulette-spot.html number="18" -%},
    $10 on the 3rd Dozen, $1 on 
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="26" -%}, {% include roulette-spot.html number="29" -%},
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="32" -%}, and {% include roulette-spot.html number="35" -%},
    and $2 on each of the 1st and 3rd columns.
    And then there's a final $1 straight-up bet that you can put in the 3rd dozen on one of the 8 uncovered numbers.
