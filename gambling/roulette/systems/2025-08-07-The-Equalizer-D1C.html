title: The Equalizer D1C - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-09-05-Golden-Entry" displayName="Fibonacci" %}
    with two legs - one dozen and one column. Also, you don't reset to the beginning on a win, you only
    go back two tiers.

    Too confusing... I like that you go with the less dependent dozen + column (as opposed to two dozens),
    since winning one bet doesn't mean that you lose the other. But there's no need to go back two steps.
    When you hit, you automatically recover from all losses, so that means your bets will eventually get
    large and STAY large.
