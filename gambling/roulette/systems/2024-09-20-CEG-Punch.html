<p>
    This is an easy two step system.
</p>
<p>
    Bet $50 on a Dozen and $50 on a Double Street not touching the dozen. If you lose or only hit the
    dozen ({%- include win-loss-amount.html amount=50 -%}), then bet this tier again. If you hit the
    Double Street ({%- include win-loss-amount.html amount=200 -%}), then proceed to tier 2.
</p>
<p>
    For tier 2, bet $25 on every inside bet touching a number in the 2nd column. It shouldn't be in the
    first or third row. Win or Lose, go back to tier 1 after one spin.
