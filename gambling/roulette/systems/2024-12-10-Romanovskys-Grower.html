<p>
    This is a positive progression. It's meant to ramp up and then start
    printing wins using
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2020-08-13-Romanovsky" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    There's a lot of hedging with this system. There's not a good chance that you'll
    win more than $100. It's mostly a slow grind.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=20 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=26 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    This system is similar to 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-09-05-Golden-Entry" %}
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2020-08-13-Romanovsky" %}
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    It would be an {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    if there were more opportunity to win big.
