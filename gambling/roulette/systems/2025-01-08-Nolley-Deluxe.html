title: Nolley Deluxe - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This system starts out as
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2024-10-14-Nolley-Molley" %}
    with two equally sized Dozen or Column bets. Then it goes into the lobsided
    Nolley bet and stays there, where you press your winnings and
    maintain the lobsided bets instead of resetting to the two equally
    sized bets.
</p>
<p>
    Tier 1: Bet two Dozens or Columns at $25 each. If you hit, then go to
    tier 2.
</p>
<p>
    Tier 2: Bet two Dozens or Columns, betting $25 on one and $50 on the
    other. Stay here if you push, reset to tier 1 if you get whacked, and
    go to the next tier if you hit the big bet.
</p>
<p>
    Tier 3: Bet two Dozens or Columns, betting $50 on one and $100 on the
    other. Stay here if you push, reset to tier 1 if you get whacked, and
    go to the next tier if you hit the big bet.
</p>
<p>
    Keep pressing until you hit the big bet on the $200+100 tier. Then reset
    to tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    Stop when you're up $1000 or more. Some people might walk when up $500.
</p>
<p>
    This is a good system, but you really just need to hit the dozen to
    advance after that first tier. That's fine, but the whole 12 numbers
    for pushing is too much of a hedge for me. I'd rather just parlay the
    whole bet on a single dozen and get to the end game faster.
