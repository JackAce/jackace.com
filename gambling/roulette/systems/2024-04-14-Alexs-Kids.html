    For some reason, Alex didn't double his bets after the first loss.
    For some reason, the author doesn't know how to count (his betting
    amount total was incorrect). For some reason, the system author chose
    a buy-in of $500, which isn't even 3 bullets. For some reason, the
    person editing the video thought the win was $260, when it is $160 on
    the second tier.

<p>
    This system straight up sucks. The buy-in amount doesn't make sense.
    The numbers chosen don't make sense. This is just an all around
    garbage system with little to zero value.
