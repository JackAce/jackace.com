<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system. Double up when you win, and on the second tier, you always
    reset, win or lose.
</p>
<p>
    This is meant to be a swing-for-the-fences system with a single $100
    bullet. Try to win $100, then make a do or die $200 bet.
</p>
<p>
    This is a pretty good way to parlay your money, but for tier 1, I'd
    probably just do a single $100 even money bet.
