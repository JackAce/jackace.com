    This is supposed to be a twist on 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2024-02-08-Triple-Entry-Max-Climax" -%}.
    When you lose all 3 bets, Martingale. If you win 1/3, then add one unit to each bet.
    If you win 2/3, then reduce one unit. If you win all 3, then reduce your bet by 50%.

    This system is needlessly complicated. I don't see a lot of opportunity for making
    a large sum of money.
