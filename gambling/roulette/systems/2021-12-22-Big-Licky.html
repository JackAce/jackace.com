    Just a simple 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Flat Bet" %}
    system. It's a bit absurd betting random values like $28 on the dozen and
    $2 or $3 on the straight-up bets.

<p>
    They kept saying that the bet was $69, but it was only $67. If only
    CEG used the <a href="https://rba.jackace.com/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a>.

<p>
    I wouldn't play a system with all these random bets. Much better to keep
    the values as multiples of $5 and bet multi-number bets instead of straight-up.
