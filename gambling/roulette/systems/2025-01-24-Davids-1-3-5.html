<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" -%}.
    When you win, go on to the next tier.
</p>
<p>
    You basically start with a Dozen/Column, bet. Parlay that win to an
    even money bet. When that wins, peel off the initial bet and put the
    rest back on a Dozen/Column.
</p>
<p>
    If you go through that cycle, you can repeat with a two unit initial
    bet. This continues through the 3 step process, but they never passed
    the 5th tier, so I can't be 100% sure.

    I like this system. It's a good low limit grinder. Seems like there are
    lots of opportunities for profit taking with bets on high percentage
    winning bets (Even Money and 2:1s). This is a great low limit system.
