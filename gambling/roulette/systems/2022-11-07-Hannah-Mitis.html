<p>
    This is an absolute garbage system where you're betting on 36 numbers at a time.
</p>
<p>
    Bet $10 on Red.
</p>
<p>
    When you lose, double the losing bet and bet $10 on the opposite color.
</p>
<p>
    So if you spin Black, then bet $10 on Black and $20 on Red.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the time, you're going to end up with $10 on one color and some power of 2 times $10 on the
    other color.
