<p>
    Ridiculous system where you bet one number, bet 2, then 3...all the way up to 12 (and fill up a dozen block),
    and then
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
    that dozen until you win.
</p>
<p>
    I'm only providing a graphic for the first tier of betting, where you win $175. For every nickel you add, you
    lose $5 of that win. So if you bet $15, the win is only $165.
