<ul>
    <li>
        Bet $50 on two even money bets (non-opposite).
    </li>
    <li>
        If that wins, bet $100 on two even money bets (non-opposite).
    </li>
    <li>
        If that wins, bet $25 on 6 non-overlapping corner bets (Rumple) and $25 on an uncovered Split (e.g. 0/00).

    <li>
        (Optional) If that wins, bet $50 on 6 non-overlapping corner bets (Rumple) and $50 on an uncovered Split
        (e.g. 0/00).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can bet 2 dozens instead of Rumple for steps 3 and 4. And you can pick any uncovered Split instead of
    0/00.

    This was labeled as a "buddy system", which...I just don't understand. Two people working together
    won't help or hurt the 5.26% house advantage in any way shape or form. You'll still lose 5.26% of all
    money wagered.

    If you're talking about playing BOTH sides of the same bet (e.g. Red AND Black) at the same time,
    that changes my rating to an 
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="f" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=true -%}.

    You should never bet on more than 35 numbers at a time, because you end up in a <b>Bet Nullification</b>
    situation. Watch this video to learn more about it:
