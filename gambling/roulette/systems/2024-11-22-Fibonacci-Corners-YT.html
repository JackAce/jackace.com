title: Fibonacci Corners YT â›¶ - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is a Multi-Leg version of Fibonacci Corners. The 3 corner bets and the
    column bet work independently on their own Fibonacci sequence.
</p>
<p>
    I don't like Multi-Leg systems and I don't like weird Fibonacci variants.
</p>
<p>
    I'm showing the betting payoffs for the Fibonacci sequence if you lose both
    sets of bets...but most of the time, you'll hit them at different times.

    Quite the discrepancy with this video. 
    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=430 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=250 -%}.
