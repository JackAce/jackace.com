title: Marital Bliss - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This was labeled as a "couple's system", which is usually a kiss of death.
    It's a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Negative Progression" %}
    system where you apply Fibonacci against your 3 corner bets (the same as a
    3 unit Dozen bet). You skip the first step of Fibonacci and basically bet
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... You don't repeat the first bet like you usually do with
    Fibonacci.

    I'm only considering this a single player system. It makes zero sense to
    try to evaluate a couple's system as anything besides combining all bets
    as a single betting pattern.

    But, I'm only going to take a look at the system with regards to Alex's bets.
