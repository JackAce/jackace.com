    Negative Progression system. When you lose 3x on a level, proceed to the next
    tier. Reset when you win.

    Not really sure what is going on with this sytem. At 9:41, it says Alex won
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=231 -%}, but I think that's the number
    of UNITS won. He was betting $5 units, so 5x231 is
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=1155 -%}.
