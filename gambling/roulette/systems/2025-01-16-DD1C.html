    At the beginning of the video, Alex changed the system...and then he
    changed it again. Don't expect too much consistency when watching
    this video.

<p>
    For the first bet, they changed the system at the last second. This
    meant changing it from a 2 Dozen bet to a 1 Dozen + 1 Column system.
    This also meant that they removed some overlap on the Double Street
    bet. But after that first bet, they moved the Double Street back into
    a full overlap with the Dozen bet.

    I really hate it when they just play systems ad hoc. There's no
    consistency on where they press their winnings. They just take the
    extra chips and throw them where they think they might go. This might
    otherwise be a decent system.
</p>
<p>
    Pretty big discrepancy in the end. Lots of misreporting in the video.
