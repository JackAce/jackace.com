title: USC üèá - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    As a UCLA Bruin, eff this system. Literally. That's probably why
    Alex and CEG gave this an
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="F" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
</p>
<p>
    USC is supposed to stand for "Ultimate Couple's System"...but that don't work, does it?
</p>
<p>
    I wouldn't give this system such a low score. It's not TERRIBLE, but again with the PUSHES!!
    No more pushes, please!
</p>
<p>
    And things go from bad to worse if you really do play this as a "couple's system", as the
    system author suggests. The pushes will explode wildly if you do this.
</p>
<p>
    This system doesn't do a good job of consolidating wins, and there are too many pushes.
    There's a narrow opportunity to win a small amount.
