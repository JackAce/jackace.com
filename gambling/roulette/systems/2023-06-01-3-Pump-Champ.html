    <ul>
        <li>
            Bet $25 on any Dozen or Column.
        </li>
        <li>
            If that wins, raise the bet to $50 (pocket $25).
        </li>
        <li>
            If that wins, raise the bet to $175 (pocket $75).
        </li>
        <li>
            If that wins, stay at that $75 bet (or raise the bet if you want to continue the progression).
        </li>
        <li>
            If you lose at any point, reset to the first tier.
        </li>
    </ul>
