title: Padovan Corners ♦️♦️♦️♦️ - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is the 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Negative Progression" %}
    that I reviewed several weeks ago. It is a modification of the 
    Padovan Streets system, but with a larger target.

<p>
    Bet $10 spread across two non-overlapping Corner bets. Increase on a 
    loss according to the Padovan Sequence, which is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37...

    When you win, reset to tier 1.
