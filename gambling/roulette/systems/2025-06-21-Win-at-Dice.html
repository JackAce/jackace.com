    Ugh - I really dislike these systems where you make a bunch of small bets that
    can all be consolidated. Here, you're just betting on 16 numbers and you could
    bet a dozen plus a corner instead of 8 split bets.

    Better yet, just bet an even money bet and take the smaller win. I always strive
    for simplicity.
