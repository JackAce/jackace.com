title: Two Step Double - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %} system.
    Just go to the next step when you win.
</p>
<p>
    The first step is similar to 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2024-10-14-Nolley-Molley" -%},
    where you have two large bets, with one bet being a sacrificial hedge in order
    to push a large percentage of the time.
</p>
<p>
    I don't like hedging. I don't like them, Sam I Am.
</p>
<p>
    Even though this is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %} system,
    there's not a huge potential for a major jackpot. It's because you're spread
    too thin.
