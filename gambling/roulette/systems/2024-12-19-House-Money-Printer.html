title: House Money Printer - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is a positive progression system. When you win, go to the next
    tier. On tier 3, if you win, just continue with tier 3.
</p>
<p>
    Not a bad system. Two easy bets to get up $80, then spread the $80
    around to capture some small wins with the occasional $100 winner.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've hit the 3rd tier, you're "playing with the house's money,"
    so to speak. Hopefully you hit a few {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=100 %}
    wins.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=20 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=26 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    This system is similar to 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-09-05-Golden-Entry" %}
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2020-08-13-Romanovsky" %}
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    It would be an {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    if there were more opportunity to win big.
