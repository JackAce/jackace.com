<p>
    This is a simple Flat Bet system.
</p>
<p>
    Walk when you're up $400.
</p>
<p>
    Even though you buy in for $1000, you're supposed to quit when you're down
    $500. That. doesn't. make. sense.
</p>
<p>
    I'd give this system a much higher rating if there weren't so many pushes.
    I'd rather have more losses and bigger wins than a bunch of pushes.
