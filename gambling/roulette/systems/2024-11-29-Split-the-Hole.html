<p>
    A simple flat betting system with 4 nice bumps on 
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="0" -%},
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="00" -%},
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="17" -%}, and
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="21" -%}.

    Walk when you're up $500 or so.

    Alex changed the system a bit to add pressing wins. I am not reviewing
    the altered system. I'm just rating the flat bet system.
