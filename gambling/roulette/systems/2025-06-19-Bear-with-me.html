    Every time you hit the small win, press that win into the
    other bets. The goal is to hit the corner bet, which is the
    jackpot. When you hit the jackpot, then reset to tier 1.

    Walk when you're up
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=350 -%}.

    This is a pretty good system, but I think I'd make the bets
    easier to make and I'd use rounder numbers. Other than that,
    it has a lot of potential to win a fair amount of money.
