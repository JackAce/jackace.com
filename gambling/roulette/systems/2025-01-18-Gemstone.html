<p>
    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Negative Progression" %}
    system. Press up each of the 9 bets $1 when you lose. It sucks because
    the payouts are always relatively different. You can't just multiply
    the first tier by a number to get the payout.

<p>
    I'm only going to show the payout images for the first 4 tiers.

<p>
    I can't tell how much Alex was up or down at the end, but looks like
    what I am displaying is much different than what they had.
