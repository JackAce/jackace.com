<p>
    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system with some very loose definitions on how to play. Start off with $100
    buy-in and make two $50 bullets that you try to win some "house money" with
    using Even Money bets. If one of those bullets hits, split that into five
    $10 mini-bullets. With those mini-bullets, you try to parlay each into another
    $50 win.

    This...can't be simulated. This is just betting vibes. Not really sure what
    to make of this. If you can't dictate what the next bet is...is it really
    a system?
