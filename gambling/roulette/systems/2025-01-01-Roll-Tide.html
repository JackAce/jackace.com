title: Roll Tide - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Ladder" %} system where you
    bet $10 on a Double Street (tier 1) and press to a $25 bet if you hit
    it (tier 2).
</p>
<p>
    If you lose, then you go to tier 3 with a $10 Double Street and a $10
    hedge on a Dozen bet that is uncovered.
</p>
<p>
    When you bet a Dozen and the Double Street, you continue to the next
    tier if you ONLY hit the Dozen. This presses both bets with the
    winnings.
