title: Roll Tide - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Ladder" %} system where you
    bet $10 on a Double Street (tier 1) and press to a $25 bet if you hit
    it (tier 2).
</p>
<p>
    If you lose, then you go to tier 3 with a $10 Double Street and a $10
    hedge on a Dozen bet that is uncovered.
</p>
<p>
    When you bet a Dozen and the Double Street, you continue to the next
    tier if you ONLY hit the Dozen. This presses both bets with the
    winnings.

    Alex and David were all over the place with this system. They seemed to
    violate the rules of this system several times. I feel like they just
    didn't care to stick with the system.
</p>
<p>
    This isn't a really bad system. I just think there are too many steps and
    it's very unlikely that you'll climb to the top tier and hit your 
    Double Street for big profits.
