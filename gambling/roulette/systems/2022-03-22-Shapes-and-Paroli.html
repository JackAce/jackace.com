<p>
    I'm not really sure why my numbers don't match the actual win. They should have been up
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=195 %}
    by my calculations, but they were up
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=265 %} somehow.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the spins where I think they messed up the win/loss display:
</p>
<table class="condensed-table">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Spin #
        </th>
        <th>
            #
        </th>
        <th>
            CEG's displayed win/loss
        </th>
        <th>
            My calculated win/loss
        </th>

<p>
    I'm not sure how the numbers got so messed up. Either I can't see the right amounts or 
    Lauren bet the wrong amounts on some of the numbers.
