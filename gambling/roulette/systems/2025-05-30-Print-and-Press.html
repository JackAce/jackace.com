<p>
    This seems like a cool little 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system. When you win, go to the next step.
</p>
<p>
    This system progresses quite slowly. There's not a big potential to
    win tons, but it gives you a chance to make a little bit of money.
</p>
<p>
    I'd rather have quicker progessing betting levels and a higher
    potential for winning larger amounts. I don't like that the top 
    tier win is lower than the 2nd highest tier win.
