<p>
    This system is a multi-leg version of 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-12-17-36DD" displayName="D'Alembert" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    Make 4 bets: 3 even money bets and 1 column bet. $5 each bet.
    You will D'Alembert each bet independently, so increase each bet by one $5
    when you lose. Decrease each bet by one $5 unit when you win. Each bet
    grows or shrinks independently as it hits or misses.
</p>
<p>
    I would avoid betting dozens with this system, unless you pick the 2nd dozen,
    which intersects the High/Low bets with 6 numbers.
</p>
<p>
    I have problems with multi-leg systems, especially negative progression
    multi-leg systems. It just seems like you're greatly increasing your chances
    of going broke by having 4 independent single points of failure.
</p>
<p>
    Mostly because this is a Multi-Leg system I've given it a 
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="d" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
</p>

<p>
    Because of the way that Alex bet this system, he ended up betting on all 36 numbers.
