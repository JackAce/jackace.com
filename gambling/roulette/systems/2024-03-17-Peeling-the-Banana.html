<p>
    Bet 1 unit ($5) on 32 numbers. When you hit, remove one of the bets. Keep doing that
    until you are only covering 24 numbers.
</p>
<p>
    If you LOSE, then
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
    the losing bet... Stay at the higher level for 2 wins.
</p>
<p>
    I can't make graphics for each betting level. You make another 1 unit for each bet you
    "peel" away. And Martingale will double your wins and losses.
</p>
<p>
    This system is garbage. There's just too big a risk of ruin. The Martingale
    really kills it.

    Alex was up $160, but he should have been up $170.
