    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    with heavy influence from

    It's 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2022-09-12-Ride-or-Die" %} with
    an additional first step and it cuts off the last step. You "limp in" with a $5
    even money bet. When this hits, you progress to the first 3 steps of

    They moved the dozen bet on tiers 2, 3, and 4, but you can keep it the same for
    all 3 tiers. You can even bet the columns if you want.

    I really like this system, but the stakes are just too low to get too excited. I
    think a lot of people will like this system, because so many people hate the top
    tier bet for Ride-or-Die.
