<p>
    This is a goofy 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
    system. Double up when you lose, and reset when you win...
    although you won't fully recover from the loss.

    I don't understand why you don't 5x Martingale or why you don't
    require more wins before resetting. If you get whacked, it just
    takes too long to recover.
