    This is a simple 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system where you move to the next tier when you win. On the third tier,
    keep playing the same tier until you win or lose. If you push, stay on
    the 3rd tier.

    I really hate all the pushes on tier 3. That is the big thing that drags
    this system down for me.
