    Wot? A 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Flat Bet" %}
    system? Why buy in for $2,000 when the bet is $270?

    There are too many pushes for me. I think pushes are bad. The best
    thing about this system is the progression simplicity and the 
    comp value...but the bet is too complicated, the payouts are
    weird, and it's just too hard to keep track of payments.
