    Negative Progression
</p>
<p>
    Start with either a corner or a Double Street bet of $25. You keep increasing your
    coverage of the felt by one unit when you lose. When you cover most of the felt
    (5 double streets or 6 corners), then start to Martingale your bets until you've
    recovered.

    Apparently, this system is supposed to be played as a team. "Team" systems are always
    worthless.

    Alex played the Double Street version,
    David played the Corner bet version.

    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="d" showRatingLetter=true -%},
    because it's really not well thought out. It just seems like you're going to
    keep increasing your bets until you run into a brick wall. There's really
    very little chance of escaping failure.
