title: Double Trouble 👯‍♀️ - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    Goofy 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Negative Progression" %}
    system where you keep adding numbers (double your coverage) when you 
    miss. Go from betting 2 numbers, to 4 numbers, 8 numbers, etc.
</p>
<p>
    For some reason, on the 5th tier, you jump up to $10 per number. Ok...
</p>
<p>
    Seems like a silly system with extremely high risk on tier 5.
