    Positive Progression system. Go to the next tier when you win. Reset to tier 1 
    when you lose.

    This system is similar to Hopscotch, where your wins keep getting pressed as you
    inch forward in bet size. But I'm really not a fan of this one. The bets don't seem
    to continually grow in winnings. Sometimes they get larger, sometimes they get smaller.
    I don't like that.

    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%},
    but it would probably be an
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    if the payouts weren't so low. I also don't like the continual press. I think it'e better to
    just go for larger hits with a smaller number of spots covered.
