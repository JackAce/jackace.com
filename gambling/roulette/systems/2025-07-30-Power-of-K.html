title: Power of K - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system where you just keep pressing $15 wins on various parts of the
    betting layout. Your goal is to keep pressing until you hit the
    Split bet.

<p>
    There's just too much on the table for such a small win...EVEN IF you hit
    your jackpot goal of hitting that Split bet. No likey.
