    $10 on an Even money bet (Red/Black/Odd/Even...Don't bet High/Low), and
    $10 on a Dozen. Keep the $10 Dozen bet frozen, but

    the Even money bet on a loss.

    Alex moved the dozen bet around as well as the even money bet.

    If you want to Martingale, just Martingale. The $10 hedge is just
    nonsense.
