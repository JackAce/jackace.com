title: Rumple Du Bois - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This video aired on December 26th along with 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2021-12-26-Turn-Coal-Into-Diamonds" -%},
    but the database doesn't like having multiple systems that aired on the same day,
    so I just flubbed the air date by a day.

<p>
    Walk at $750 profit according to the system author.
</p>
<p>
    Start out with the $15 bets, if that hits, drop down to $5 bets. If that hits, go
    up to $10 bets...then $75 bets...If you get whacked, then start over. I don't know
    why. Such a strange system.
</p>
<p>
    Seems like such a long shot to just bet $450 out of the blue. Not getting this system.
