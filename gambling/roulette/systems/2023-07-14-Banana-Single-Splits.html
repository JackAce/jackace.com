    You're supposed to put $10 on the "same color (vertical) splits" which are
    the 8/11, 9/12, 10/13, 16/19, 17/20, 18/21, 26/29, 27/30, and 28/31 (9 total bets).
    Why do we pick these numbers? No one knows.

    After that, pick 8 numbers straight up and put $5 on each. I picked numbers that are in
    the same row as the chosen splits to make consolidation easier. The Straight-up bets I chose
    are different than what Alex picked.

    You're essentially betting $5 on 26 different numbers. Picking the
    same color splits is just a waste of time.
