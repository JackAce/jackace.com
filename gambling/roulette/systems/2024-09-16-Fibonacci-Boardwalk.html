<p>
    Start with a $25 bet on a Dozen. When you win, take your winnings and pocket $10. Take the
    rest of the winnings and put it on a Dozen.
</p>
<p>
    When you lose, go through the Fibonacci process: $25, $25, $50, $75, $125, $200...
</p>
<p>
    Whatever the bet is, you are going to win double when you hit and lose everything when you
    miss. For that reason, I won't post all the betting tier images.
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="3" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    because I just think it's too hard to break through with a big win. Just Fibonacci by itself
    is fine because it gives you a steady win. This system Nerfs your wins because you're just
    pocketing a small amount and YOLO'ing the rest of your wins until if fizzles out.
