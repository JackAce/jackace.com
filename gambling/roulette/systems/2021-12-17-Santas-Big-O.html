<p>
    Another 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %} system.
    When you lose, double up and stay there until you hit the Split 
    bet twice.
</p>
<p>
    I don't like betting all these splits. You could just bet a Dozen
    ($30) and a Corner ($10) instead. Move the $25 bet to an uncovered 
    Dozen.

    Not enough opportunity here.
