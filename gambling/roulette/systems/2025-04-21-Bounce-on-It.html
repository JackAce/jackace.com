<p>
    This is a slow progresing 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system.
</p>
<p>
    After winning 3x in a row, go to the next step.
</p>
<p>
    For the 3rd tier, you can either bet $90 on an Even Money bet, or you
    can bet 9 Splits at $10 each. Same Same.
</p>
<p>
    This system has a $160 starting bet, which is HUGE, but then it
    drops down after the first tier...Which makes it NOT a good
    comp system. You can't play this on a single zero wheel, so
    It really hurts the rating for this system.
