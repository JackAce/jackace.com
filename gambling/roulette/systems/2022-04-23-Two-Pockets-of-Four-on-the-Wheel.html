    I am really not a fan of the dealer just asking the player to pay the amount bet so
    he doesn't have to reconfigure the bets on the layout. Perhaps this makes for a better
    video, but these system reviews are meant to judge how good a system is. If putting the
    bets out there is hard or awkward, then the system reviewer should have to experience that
    awkwardness before judging whether they like this system.

    Also, this led to many dealer mistakes, which is bad for a dealing school to be displaying
    on their videos.
