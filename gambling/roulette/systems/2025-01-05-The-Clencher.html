title: The Clencher - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a somewhat complicated
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Ladder" %}
    system where you increase your bet by half a unit when you
    lose, but YOLO/Parlay your wins when you hit.
</p>
<p>
    You start out with two $10 bets each on two Dozens or Columns.
    If you lose both bets, increase each bet by $5.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever you hit, take all the money on the table and bet it
    all on a single Dozen or Column.
