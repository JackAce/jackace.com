title: 1300s â™ž - Roulette System Review

<p>
    This is supposed to be a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
    system, but Alex changed the betting tiers to hit recovery
    levels 2x before regressing to the lower bets.
</p>
<p>
    Also, the displayed wins were often off in the video. I have Alex being up $225 at
    the end, but he was only up $150 in the video.

    Alex rated this an Eggplant, but they displayed Grapefruit for some reason...
