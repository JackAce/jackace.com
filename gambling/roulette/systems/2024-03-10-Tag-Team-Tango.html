<p>
    As far as "2 player systems" go, you should NEVER bet on 36 or more numbers at a
    time between the two players.
</p>
<p>
    Here you're betting $25 each on both Red and Black.
</p>
<p>
    You're also betting $25 on each of the 3 dozens ($50 on the 2nd dozen).
</p>
<p>
    All these bets should be eliminated, since each bet pays the others off when they win,
    but they ALL lose when 0/00 hit.
</p>
<p>
    If you're playing as a "team", then it doesn't make sense to make these bets.
</p>
<p>
    Remove these bets, and you've reduced the $170 in bets to just $45. Your expected loss
    per spin goes down from -$8.94 to -$2.37, saving over $6 in EV per spin.

    At the end the two were up $105, not $95 as they stated.
