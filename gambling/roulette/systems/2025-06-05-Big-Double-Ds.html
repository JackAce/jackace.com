title: Big Double D's üçàüçà - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system, where you increase your bets (actually change your bets) when you lose,
    hoping to recover faster and end up in profit.
</p>
<p>
    This system is just a giant mess, there are 13 levels (I think because Alex modified
    it while in play) and the bets are all over the place. Realistically, no one is
    going to play this goofy system.
</p>
<p>
    You're supposed to walk when you're up $200.
</p>
<p>
    Alex just kept buying in for more... That's why he finally ended up for the session.
