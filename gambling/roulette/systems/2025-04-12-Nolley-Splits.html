<p>
    This is a goofy 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system where you increase your bets, then regress as you keep winning.

<p>
    This system is too hard to hit for the cycle and you don't get a
    big payday when you do. It allows you to slowly creep up the ladder
    and profit take, but this system seems like a slow grind.
