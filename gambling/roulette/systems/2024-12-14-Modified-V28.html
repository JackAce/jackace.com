title: Modified V28 - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This system is congruent to the first tier of the original 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-07-24-V28" %}
    system.
</p>
<p>
    Since this system is basically the same as the original, I'll give it
    the same score. The only difference is this system bets on Splits instead
    of Corners. I'd actually bet two dozens and one corner, though.

    Alex said he was up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=20 -%},
    but I have him being up {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=26 -%}.
</p>
<p>
    This system is similar to 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-09-05-Golden-Entry" %}
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2020-08-13-Romanovsky" %}
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="b" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}.
    It would be an {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="a" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    if there were more opportunity to win big.
