title: Crimson Cloak - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a goofy system where you "pick a color", and bet $110 on it. Then you pick 11
    numbers of the opposite color and bet $10 on each. You push when you hit the color,
    you win
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=140 %}
    when you hit the straight-up numbers.
</p>
<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Flat Bet" %}
    system, although you have the option of switching between betting on Red and betting
    on Black. As for betting the "opposite" color, you can also bet on 
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="0" %} or
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="00" %} as well. That's what Alex did with
    his Black bet configuration.

    I'm not a fan of pushing. That is going to affect this system's ratings
    negatively.
