<p>
    Lots of errors with the display of wins and losses with this video.
</p>
<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Ladder" %}
    system, where you just double your bet after EVERY spin (whether
    you win or lose).
</p>
<p>
    This is just a dumb system with no real goals except for the
    tail wagging the dog. Everything is always going to depend on
    how your big bets do.
