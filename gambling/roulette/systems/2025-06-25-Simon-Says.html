<p>
    This system is just a giant mess. Way too complicated and there's
    little to no opportunity to win big.
</p>
<p>
    There is a huge list of rules for this ladder system, based on the last
    digit of the last number that hit.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 0, you bet $40 on an even money bet.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 1, you bet $20 on a dozen or column.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 2, you bet $20 each on two dozens.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 3, you bet $5 on 3 corner bets.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 4, you bet $5 on 4 corner bets.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 5, you bet $5 on 5 street bets.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 6, you bet $5 on 6 street bets.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 7, you bet $5 on 7 split bets.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 8, you bet $5 on 8 split bets.
</p>
<p>
    If the last digit is a 9, you bet $5 on 9 straight-up bets.
</p>
<p>
    This system is just awful. Don't play this.
