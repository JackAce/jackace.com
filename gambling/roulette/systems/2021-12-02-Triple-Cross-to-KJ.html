<p>
    This is a complex 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Ladder" %}
    system that involves pressing, Martingaling, and halving.
</p>
<p>
    It's kinda like
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-12-17-36DD" displayName="D'Alembert" %}, 
    but you press when you win, and you Martingale when you lose.
</p>
<p>
    This system is pretty complicated. Not a fan of the complexity. No system should involve
    sometimes pressing and sometimes halving.
