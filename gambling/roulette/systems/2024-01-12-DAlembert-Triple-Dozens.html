title: D'Alembert Triple Dozen - Roulette System Review
---

<p>
    Multi-Leg system for D'Alembert using 3 bets: 2 Dozens and 1 Column.
</p>
<p>
    Each leg is incremented and decremented independently of the other two bets.
</p>
<p>
    Alex said he was down
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=-290 %}    
    at the end, but I have him clocked at
    {% include win-loss-amount.html amount=-130 -%}. Sometimes the displayed win/loss
    values are way off. I'm not sure what caused this discrepancy.
