title: Risk vs. Reward Double Your Loss Martingale - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    The system author claims to be up $40,000 using this system, but I have some doubts about that, given the
    escalation of this system. Seems like you'd go broke pretty quickly. But it's possible that the author
    hasn't hit a bad enough streak yet.

<p>
    "Double Your Loss Martingale". When you've lost, double the TOTAL amount lost and bet that.
</p>
<p>
    That <i>should</i> end up with you tripling your bet after a loss (starting at the $20 level), but I think
    the system author made some mods that that scheme.
</p>
<p>
    This is just a quicker way to lose your bankroll quicker than Martingale. Sure, you recover your losses
    and even come out with a faster profit when you eventually hit your number, but you're sure to hit the table limits 
    or the end of your bankroll quicker.

    These are all Even Money bets, so I only provided graphics for the first 2 tiers of this system.
