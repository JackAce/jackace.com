<p>
    They said Chat GPT came up with this system.
</p>
<p>
    I have two issues with this system:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Picking numbers based on the location on the wheel is useless.
        </li>
        <li>
            {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
            with just 3 numbers is suicide.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Alex got extremely fortunate. Most of the time, you're going to experience what David experienced.
    Your bets are going to climb up quickly and you'll be out of your $200 bankroll quickly.
</p>
<p>
    There is potential for big wins, but always when you're on the precipice of going broke.
