<p>
    This system is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    that is similar to Paroli, except you're betting on a 2:1 bet instead
    of an even money bet.
</p>
<p>
    Start out with a $10 bet on a dozen or column. When you win, increase
    your bet to $20 and move it to the next dozen/column. When that hits,
    move again to the remaining dozen/column. Win or lose on the 3rd tier,
    reset to tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    This wouldn't be a bad system, but you're not going to win the dozens
    bet enough to go far with this. The double your bet strategy works best
    with even money bets.
