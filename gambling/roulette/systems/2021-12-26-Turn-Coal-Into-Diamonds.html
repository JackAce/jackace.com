title: Turn Coal Into Diamonds - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a YOLO system with a TINY buy-in of $20. You shoot your shot
    and keep parlaying your wins, trying to turn $20 into $180
    ({%- include win-loss-amount.html amount=160 -%}).

    It's quite simple, but I'd definitely try to simplify the bets. For
    tier 3, I'd just bet $60 on an Even Money bet.
