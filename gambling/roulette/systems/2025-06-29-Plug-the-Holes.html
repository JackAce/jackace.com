title: Plug the Holes - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a horrible horrible horrible 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system. There are just too many pushes. Yuk.
</p>
<p>
    Not only that, but even with the 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" -%},
    the win amounts don't really get any larger. In fact, they seem to 
    fade away and taper off at the end. Not good.
