title: 3 V's R Better than 1 - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    Just a simple flat betting system.
</p>
<p>
    You're supposed to walk away when you hit one of the jackpots.
</p>
<p>
    Alex changed the system to a Positive Progression system on spin 8.
</p>
<p>
    I gave this system a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="d" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %}
    because this is just a simple 2 bet pattern that has been shuffled around into 9 bets. You
    can get the same wins/losses with a $45 High bet with a column bet.
