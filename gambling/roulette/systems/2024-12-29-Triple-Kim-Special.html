title: Triple Kim Special - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system that starts out as 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2024-02-08-Triple-Entry-Max-Climax" %}
    and launches into 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2024-10-14-Nolley-Molley" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    Tier 1: Start out with three $50 even money bets.
</p>
<p>
    Win 0/3: Repeat tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    Win 1/3: Go to tier 2: Bet $50 each on two Dozens or Columns. This is the "Second Chance" bet.
</p>
<p>
    Win 2/3: Go to tier 3: Bet $100 each on two Dozens or Columns. Trying to get to a $150 gain from the bullet.
</p>
<p>
    Win 3/3: Go to tier 4: Bet the lobsided Nolley with $100 on one Dozen and $50 on another.
</p>
<p>
    Tier 5: Spread $150 on a bunch of numbers all haphazard and with no rhyme or reason at all. Alex bet 12
    numbers with bet sizes from $5 to $20. Yo, WTF?
</p>
<p>
    I can't believe Alex crafted this system and then ended up giving himself a
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="c" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false -%}. I really
    don't like the confusing progression. This gets a 
    {% include ceg-system-rating.html rating="d" showRatingLetter=true showRatingName=false %} from me.
