title: Fibonacci Chase - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    So...you sometimes bet dozens...you sometimes bet even money bets...
    You use Fibonacci...but you kinda don't...
</p>
<p>
    There's a 
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-09-05-Golden-Entry" display="Fibonacci" %}
    for the 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %} element of
    this system. You follow the Dozen/Column of the last spin when you 
    lose.
</p>
<p>
    When you hit your Dozen bet, then you parlay the entire thing on
    an Even Money bet of your choice.
</p>
<p>
    If that Even Money bet wins...you parlay that bet + your winnings
    but you remove $10(?) or something like that???
</p>
