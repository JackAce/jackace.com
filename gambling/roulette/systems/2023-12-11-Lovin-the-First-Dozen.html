title: Lovin' the First Dozen ðŸ¤Ÿ - Roulette System Review

<p>
    Start with $50 each on 2 dozens. If that wins, go to $75 on 2 dozens. If that wins, bet $125 on an
    even money bet. If that wins...?
</p>
<p>
    If you lose in the positive progression, then reset to tier 1.
</p>
<p>
    If you lose at the first tier, then
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    I really think the Martingale aspect of this system is going to wipe you out most of the time (as witnessed in the video).
