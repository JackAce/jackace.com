title: 60/40 - Roulette System Review

<p>
    You're supposed to bet 2 dozens that hit(?) after 2 blank spins (no bet). And then keep betting those dozens...
</p>
<p>
    After betting $10 on each of the 2 dozens, you jump up to $60 each. After that you keep adding $60 per bet when you lose.
    For some reason, the system author called this 6x
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" -%},
    which is not accurate.
</p>
<p>
    If you win, then you step down to the previous betting tier.
</p>
<p>
    Either the system author doesn't know how to properly describe their system or it was poorly executed by the CEG team.
    "6x Martingale" does <b>NOT</b> mean you add 6 units. And you don't even add 6 units when going from $10 to $60 on each bet.
</p>
<p>
    This system doesn't really make any sense to me.
