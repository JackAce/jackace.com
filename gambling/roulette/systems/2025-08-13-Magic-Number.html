    This is a twist on

    This system really doesn't make sense... You bet $75 for the first tier and if you WIN $75,
    you jump up to a $225 bet? What if you don't have enough money? This is a weird system where
    even if you WIN, you might not have enough money for the next bet.

    I LIKE the jackpot potential, but this is going to be too difficult to play in real life. The
    fact that you can win and not have enough for the next bet makes it a bad system.
