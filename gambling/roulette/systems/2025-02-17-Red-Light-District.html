    This is a low limit 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    where you make a bunch of $1 bets.

The real bad thing about this system is that you're spread too thin.
    There are lots of pushes and lots of numbers where you have small
    losses, but don't get completely whacked. I'd rather have a smaller
    target with bigger wins.

    I don't get the appeal of putting money on a bet and <i>STILL</i> ending
    up with a net loss when it hits.
