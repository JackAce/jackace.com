title: This Claimer - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    You're supposed to go to the next tier when you lose 5 times in a row.
    They mention
    {% include roulette-system-link.html reviewUrl="2023-09-05-Golden-Entry" displayName="Fibonacci" -%},
    but you're supposed to for 5 losses... So strange.

<p>
    This system had some potential, but the bets are too weird...the progression
    isn't well defined... The only thing good is the potential to hit bit
    with the Double Street bets.
