    Not a bad

    system, but I'd like the biggest win to be a little bigger. I also think
    the spread is too thin... but of course, that's the trade off.

    Alex changed the betting pattern before the 6th spin. There was a large
    jackpot, but it got significantly nerfed by spreading the bets thin. I'm
    not exactly sure what their rating was based on. Tier 1 shows the original,
    Tier 2 shows the altered version.

    My rating is based on the 2nd version. I actually like the first version
    better.
