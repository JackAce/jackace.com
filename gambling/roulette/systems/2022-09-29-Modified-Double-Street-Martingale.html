title: Modified Double Street Martingale - Roulette System Review
math: true

<p>
    Simple system, low buy in. I don't really understand the 3x
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
    aspect though.
    You usually want to recover ALL losses on the next spin and STILL be up one unit.
    To do this, you'd need to 6x Martingale.
