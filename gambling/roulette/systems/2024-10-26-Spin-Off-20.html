---
<p>
    This is a Positive Progression system that is a variant of the Spin Off system.
    If you hit on step 1, go to step 2. If you win $75 on step 2, go to step 3. You can
    stay on step 3 until you double your money. Reset to step 1 when you lose.

<p>
    You can choose which dozens you want to bet on for the first 2 tiers. For tier 3, you
    can pick whatever 10 splits you want to bet so long as they don't overlap.
