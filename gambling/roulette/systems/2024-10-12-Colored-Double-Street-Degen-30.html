title: Colored Double Street Degen 3.0 ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸª- Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    Positive Progression system. On the second tier, revert to the first tier if you hit the
    Double Street or if you lose. Don't change your bet if you win $20.
</p>
<p>
    When you choose which Double Street to bet on, make sure it has 4 of your color in it, not
    3 of each.
</p>
<p>
    This is CEG's third iteration of this system, just tweaking the Double Street you're betting on
    based on how many of your color is in it.
