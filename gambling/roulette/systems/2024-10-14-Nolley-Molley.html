<p>
    Ladder system where you press $10 when you lose and you press the single Dozen/Column bet when
    you win.
</p>
<p>
    When you bet two dozens and one hits, you make the same bet, but press the win on the winning bet
    (making the bet lobsided). When you make a lobsided bet and the big bet wins, you even the bets
    out for the next spin. If you win $60 on a lobsided bet, then reset to step 1.
