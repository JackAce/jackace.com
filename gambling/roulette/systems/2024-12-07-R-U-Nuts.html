<p>
    This is a slow-moving, low-limit Negative Progression. You start out with a
    $2 Split bet. After losing 5x, increase to $3. After every 5 losses, increaase
    to the next tier. Reset to tier 1 on a win.

    This system isn't bad. I think I might just
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Martingale" %}
    with every 5th bet instead
    of the slow uptick this system is doing.
