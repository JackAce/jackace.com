title: Lucky 10 Fold üçÄ - Roulette System Review
---
<p>
    This is a 
    {% include roulette-system-type.html type="Positive Progression" %}
    system where you use 10 bullets. You're going to try to turn your $100 bullet
    into $450 
    ({%- include win-loss-amount.html amount=350 -%}).
</p>
<p>
    Whether you're up or down at the end, stop after you fire your 10 bullets.
</p>
<p>
    Not a bad system. I'd try to change it (improve it) by removing the pushes on step 3.
